4,"Some fun moments, but ultimately not a good watch overall due to the lack of a plot really",11 September 2016,"""The Secret Life of Pets"" is one of the most known animated films from the United States this year (2016). The two directors and four writers who made this include a couple names that worked on films from the Minions universe, so nobody should be surprised that a Minions short film runs before ""Pets"" and there is also another reference at the very end with one of the pets being dressed like a Minion. But back to this one here. I was as unimpressed by the outcome here as I was by the newest ""Minions"" movie. The film runs for approximately 90 minutes and gives us an insight into the life of pets and what they do when their owners are off to work and not in charge. Heard that before? That's right. The general idea here reminded me a lot of the Toy Story approach to things. And there are more references. For example, the two main characters (dogs) felt a lot like the protagonists from the ""Monsters Inc."" universe in terms of their size and interactions. So yeah, ""Pets"" definitely borrows a lot from other films, but what is the most disappointing thing is that it tries to be creative in his own right at times, but almost never succeeds and this is pretty shocking looking at how many films worked on this one.""Pets"" is definitely not a failure and there are several parts where I enjoyed it from the comedic perspective. I also liked some minor references, for example early on about how the main character does not like to be at home alone. The comedy is not the problem here. It is the emotional impact. The only part where it is close to making one is when we find out about the new dog's owner and his journey back to his old owner's house. Other than that, the drama is entirely forgettable and good animation is just not enough anymore today on the level of Pixar quality. There are many flaws with the story in here. First of all, the makers thrown in one character after the other without really elaborating on any of them. Honestly, counting all the (lost) pets, there are enough characters for three films in here. Another problem is their behavior. It felt a bit strange how they quickly stepped in for each other out of nowhere when moments before we still felt that they did not like each other at all and this refers to the two dogs as well as the fluffy white rabbit who turns out the main antagonist. We see all the time how evil and cold-hearted he is and then out of nowhere he risks his life for his enemies basically.Another big problem I had with the film is that I had no idea what the characters' goals were throughout the film, at least for the two dogs. Enjoy a day out? Run from the lost pets? Run from the dog-catcher? They were just out there and it really had no purpose and then in the end they return home safely and it's all good with everybody being friends with everybody. I was not convinced at all. Also about the love interest of the main character, there was contradictory behavior. On one occasions she acts as if she wants nobody to know who she has a crush on and then she screams it out to everybody. It was pretty bizarre and the writing really lacked a lot on some occasions. This is also why my overall verdict for the film is negative. I give it a thumbs-down and if they ever make a sequel I must say I have very little interest in seeing it as this film was quite a disappointment and for me personally, it is nowhere near being a contender for best animated film of 2016, even with all the known voice actors in the German as well as English version. Not even for Louis C.K., everyone can be a winner."
4,The best bits are all in the trailer,7 October 2016,"The trailer was looking promising. Lots of laughs and clever humour. Hopes were high as the trailer for Zootopia was inciting and that film did not disappoint. However, Secret Life of Pets turned out to be a fizzer. Excessively violent for a children's film, not funny or clever and really rather odd. The characters are not developed which means that the audience doesn't particularly care what happens on their quest. The stand out of the film is the husky little white fluffball of a dog. I think this film is aimed at children, though the guy down the row from me was certainly laughing a lot (while I was taking power naps). Not the same caliber as Despicable Me."
7,"Cute Movie, But A Bit Over-hyped",12 July 2016,"After hearing people praise this movie, and seeing how much it was advertised, I was curious to see this. Now, I've never loved Illumination's movies, but I've never hated them either. I don't mind any of their films, but I feel like they're not as innovative as certain other animation companies. Hearing how much people loved Secret Life of Pets gave me a bit of hope that perhaps this movie would be Illumination's breakthrough. The one that would have the best animation, story, characters, emotions, etc.Unfortunately, Secret Life of Pets just ended up being another okay movie for me. Right when I saw the trailers, I was reminded of Toy Story with the plot. I feared that the plot would be predictable, and it definitely was. A few different things were thrown in, but as a whole, the story was pretty predictable. One of the different things that was thrown in had potential to be a really emotional scene. This is a spoiler, by the way. Anyway, Duke finds out that his original owner had died, which could've led into an emotional scene, like in Finding Dory when Dory was made to believe her parents were dead. But the whole scene failed. Firstly, it was told, not shown. A random cat just gives the news to Duke. Second, Duke barely reacts to this, despite the movie going out of its way to show us a montage of him with his owner. He just gets mad at the family that moved into the owner's home before getting caught by animal control. After that, it's never mentioned again. Duke is just fine with his owner being dead, and living with a new owner and Max. This really bothers me, since as I said, this scene had potential to be emotionally provoking. But it didn't take the chance.Our main characters didn't interest me. Max is just another typical good guy that just wants a good life. Duke was just another lovable big guy who may be a bit slow. However, the only characters that made me laugh/I enjoyed were Gidget, Snowball, Tiberius, and Pops. Gidget and Snowball were the ones that really shined, though. Gidget was just plain adorable, and hilarious. As for Snowball, I'm not a big fan of Kevin Hart, but he really did a great job for his first animated film. I personally prefer him doing voice work than him in live action films. He managed to make me laugh multiple times as Snowball. That bunny may be cute, but he's totally psychotic. As for the rest of the characters, they didn't really interest me. I don't hate any of them, but they were pretty generic.I also am sick of the Minions. They got old when their own movie was made. I won't mind seeing them in Despicable Me 3, since we'll only get small doses of them, but having them constantly shoved in our faces is getting annoying. The short that came on before Secret Life of Pets was just stupid. No experimentation with the animation or characters. Just plain stupidity. They also had one of the dogs in Secret Life wear a Minions costume, and I just rolled my eyes. Minions may make Illumination money, but not many people care about them anymore. I certainly don't.I do have some positive things to say about this film. The animation was impressive. I was particularly impressed with how they animated water, and the mannerisms of the pets. Which leads into the next thing I liked about this. I admire how much the creators of the film did their research on not just dogs, but most pets people keep. They were spot on with how dogs, cats, birds, etc. act. As a dog and cat owner, I appreciate the humor/realism that went into the pets, and they reminded me of my own pets.As a whole, this a cute, but flawed film. I wasn't impressed with most of the characters. The story was predictable. Nothing about this film was thought or emotionally provoking. However, I appreciated some of the film's humor, animation, and the research that went into the mannerisms of the pets. It's a shame that this wasn't Illumination's breakthrough. Sure, it's making a lot of money, but it's still just an alright movie. Hopefully one day, Illumination will make a film just as great as the likes of Zootopia or Inside Out. The Secret Life of Pets just isn't that film."
4,Not much here,26 June 2017,"Unlike some of the better Pixar animated feature length films (like Finding Nemo and Toy Story) there's really not much here. (In spite of the fact that it borrows liberally from these movies, and certain Disney classics.) Don't know if it was just a ""me too"" money grab, or if the writers/producers intended to convey more depth, and just missed. The gags are cliché, the characters are very flat and rehashed at best, boring at worst. It drew laughs at a couple of points, but mostly my reaction was ""yeah, that was much funnier when (fill in movie here) did it"". The movie clocked in at less than an hour-and-a-half, but seemed much longer. That's not a compliment - it dragged. Maybe it was targeted only at young kids, and maybe young kids will enjoy it more. It actually did seem to have more of a Saturday morning cartoon feel than a feature-length film feel. Maybe you'll enjoy it - there certainly are more than a few positive reviews here - but it's not one that I'll watch again (unlike some of those Pixar and Disney movies which stand up to repeated re- viewing)."
6,Flavorless but You Could Do Worse,20 July 2016,"I start this review by first acknowledging there's nothing wrong with this film from a family-oriented entertainment point of view. It's colorful, it's fun at times, provides a positive message about acceptance and provides a clever enough high concept to keep the kids on their keesters for 80 minutes. As a rudimentary children's film, you certainly can do worse.The problem with The Secret Lives of Pets stems from its complete inability to marry story, character and concept into a discernible package. As it stands, the film is rushed, bulky and is chalked full of nonsensical choices that cripples any verdant ideas that could have been. It's a first draft; not a final product.The story begins with a happy Jack Russell Terrier named Max (C.K.) who lives with his owner Katie (Kemper) in a surprisingly roomy Manhattan apartment. Things change drastically and suddenly with the arrival of Duke (Stonestreet) a large, shaggy Newfoundland whose introduced as a ""new brother"" to Max's chagrin. They, of course don't get along and after a series of confrontations find themselves lost. The first to notice they're missing is a lovestruck Pomeranian named Gidget (Slate) who recruits the rest of Max's friends among others to recover them from the vast streets of New York City.The rest of Max's friends are barely worth mentioning as they're mostly utilized to push the buttons and pull the levers on some uninspired comedic set-pieces. They're not really useful to the plot, nor do they succeed in being the Toy Story (1995)-inspired resilient and diverse gaggle the movie hopes they are. Part of the reason for this is none of the side characters actually solve any problems. They jet here, they jet there but when faced with any obstacles they just seem to rush it. Gone is the creativity of having Mr. Potato Head fashion a new body out of a tortilla; now we have elderly Basset Hound, Pops (Carvey) hobbling through construction sites with stalwart confidence.Frankly focusing on the story's tagged-on villains might have paid more dividends. The broad machinations of Snowball (Hart), a bunny with delusions of grandeur are easily the best part of the film, even if they remain painfully underdeveloped. Additionally his ""Flushed Pets"" group could have complicated Duke's allegiance to his new owner or more easily pegged Max as a fully socialized pet and therefore in need of re-education. Snowball was the best chance the movie had in getting audiences to truly know the characters we're supposed to be rooting for but instead they blew it on prolonged chase sequences and a sausage factory bit that goes absolutely nowhere.And that gets me to the biggest problem I have with this film; the creators' approach to the high concept itself. The film tries to have its cake and eat it to, portraying characters with innately human characteristics but still clinging to the charming pet-like idiosyncrasies we know and love about our furry friends. For example, Gidget recruits the help of Tiberius (Brooks) a hawk who at first tries to eat her. She barely escapes his talons only to trust him once more because that's just what a peppy little dog would do. Max's friends Mel (Moynihan) and Buddy (Buress) don't even notice Max is gone because, being dogs, they're distracted by butterflies and squirrels. They're certainly not a rag-tag group of lovable rogues, they're a confederacy of dunces, successful only because of the ever changing allegiances of the main antagonist. Oh yeah, I almost forgot to mention Snowball at one point joins forces with Max to save Duke in a climactic sequence so blithely unnatural it renders the friends search and rescue completely moot.This film is a rushed, characterless, flavorless kids film that just barely stretches its plot over the skeleton of its story structure. As I said before, if all you're looking for is a bland and forgettable family film, you could do worse. Yet provided it's appealing concept, you'd really think the animation studio that made Despicable Me (2010) could do better."
9,Entertaining and amusing,26 June 2016,"26 June 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight. - The Secret Life of Pets. Max is the spoiled only dog belonging to Katie. His whole world revolves round her and when she brings Duke home from the pound, Max is more than a little miffed. Duke and Max fall out but are forced to help each other when they get lost and into many scrapes during the course of their day. This film, although not side splittingly funny was very amusing and the film makers are so very clever in creating a personality for each and every one of the animals in this film. I think we secretly all hope our pets have fun lives when we leave them home alone, and this film very cleverly moulds each pet to its owner and each house to fit it's pet. Applause must be given to the animators, the details which have been created in the cityscape is incredible, take time to look behind the animals for the skylines, the water, ever the sewers have so much crammed in to them I think you would need to see the film several time to take it all in, it's a long way from ink and paint!!!!"
5,the secret life of pets,4 August 2016,I went to see this with my sister and my cousins and we enjoyed it. It was funny silly and my favorite illumination movie it's worth a watch and it is definitely better than minions it is fun for the whole family. I could not stop laughing at this movie it so many great characters. the cast is pure amazing my favorite character was Kevin Hart's character snowball he was the most funniest character in the movie I don't know why this movie has a 6.8 it should have at least a 7.8. It brought me laughs from beginning to end. This movie will hopefully inspire illumination to make make new franchises next or you know despicable me 3 it's defiantly going to be that.
10,"Funny, Lighthearted, and Appropriate for All Ages!",28 July 2016,"I'm surprised this film got such a low overall score by users. I thought is was a blast. I am not an animated movie fan in the least. I normally like dark movies, dramas, sci-fi, and horror. This was the first animated film I have seen since Avatar, (which isn't the same type of animation really,) but when I watched the trailer last year, I thought it would probably be good. And it was.The movie delivered exactly what it promised: laughs. It's not earth shattering, mind blowing, and it doesn't explain the meaning of life in 90 minutes. But it's not that type of movie. It's a summer escape film, one that is a little different from the 1000th superhero movie or Sequel #10 of The Current Film of Mediocrity, and one that you can bring your children to without worrying about covering their eyes and ears every scene. There are a couple of scenes of mild violence or almost violence, but they aren't any worse than Bugs Bunny and his adventures with the Roadrunner (I suppose that reference dates me lol). What I liked the best about the movie is the way it demonstrates the thoughts and behaviors of the pets to the viewer. As a Great Dane owner, I often wonder what my dogs are thinking/doing, especially when I'm at work, and my ideas are similar to the writers. Their thoughts and conversations were the funniest parts of the film, and the scenes and soundtrack combined with the dialogue to form a lighthearted, enjoyable story."
9,"Laugh Value, Character Value, Music Value.",10 July 2016,"I saw the trailer for this movie last Summer and the first thing I said was ""I have to go see this movie."" So, needless to say I've been looking forward to this film since last summer and I had very high expectations for it. I am pleased to say it went above and beyond and met these expectations, I absolutely adored this movie and would recommend it to anybody of any age. First things first is starting from the beginning and the introduction of the characters and I thought Illumination Entertainment did a fantastic job in presenting each individual. As an audience we knew after the first ten minutes who each character was, their relationships with each other, and the individual personalities. For an animation film I was really pleased with this because you normally don't get that character depth in the beginning and sometimes you never get it in the film. As the story went on the characters developed at an individual level as well as a relationship level with others which added to the plot line drastically. Not to mention the actors and actresses who portrayed each character were spot on with the voices. However, the icing on the cake for the entire film for me was the soundtrack. The soundtrack is very important because it not only sets the pace for the film on screen but it also changes your emotions and tells you when you need to be sad, scared, happy, etc. That is exactly what this soundtrack did and it pleased me because without that human interaction happening on the screen, because it was animated, the music filled that gap and allowed your emotions to change. One problem I did have with the movie, and this was more towards the end, was the humor. The humor made me laugh in the beginning quite a bit but by the end of the movie the humor was starting to become more outrageous. Almost as if they were trying to hard to make it funny. Now even though this humor was changing a bit as the film went on it was not enough for me not to suggest seeing this movie for its laugh value. Overall, if you have a family, kids, husband, or just want to see this movie with friends I would definitely recommend. You'll laugh, you'll cry a little bit, but most importantly you will leave the theater happy."
10,Worth to watch,9 August 2016,"I was waiting for this movie since first trailer was launched. And when i had opportunity to watch it, i was more than happy. Great story line, reminds me Garfield and his new ""friend"" dog. Many characters such as lazy cat and hamster who can't find his way home made movie incredible funny. I love Kevin Hart voice and his expressions being that little, loud and angry bunny makes it more interesting. The writing was excellent, made my mom, youngest sister, and myself constantly laugh. To the targeted demographic that the film focuses on, this film will be a sure fire box office hit to them. I hope that there will be a second part of this life of pets."
9,Surprisingly Entertaining Illumination Flick,3 August 2016,"Ever since the release of Despicable Me back in 2010, Illumination has really stepped up from their previous animated movies. Whether it be the aforementioned film, its sequel, its spin-off Minions, or the 2012 adaptation of Dr. Seuss' The Lorax, it was quite a change with their latest entry The Secret Life of Pets.The plot centers around Max (Louis C.K.), a terrier living happily with his loving owner Katie (Ellie Kemper) in New York City, but when she adopts a bigger dog named Duke (Eric Stonestreet) to live with them, Max is overwhelmed by his new roommate. The two opposing dogs must then work together however, before Katie gets back when they are lost in the big city.For an original story done by Illumination, it does creatively borrow off the concepts of both Toy Story as well as the 2008 film Bolt, yet it flows out well with the voice cast bringing these characters to life which include stand-up comic Louis C.K. voicing the leading dog Max, Jenny Slate (Saturday Night Live, Zootopia) as Max's potential love interest Gidget, and 'Modern Family' star Eric Stonestreet as Duke. With quick-witted, slapstick humor that feels reminiscent of Looney Tunes (even with a tendency to adlib lines in some scenes), the real scene stealer among this talented cast goes to comedian Kevin Hart voicing adorable, yet antagonistic rabbit Snowball.While the littler ones will be kept engaged and entertained by the humorous animal characters as well as the obstacles they come across, to me personally the story feels rushed, especially the need for a little more emotional depth and better character development. I know there's a lot more to offer in this story's universe, so a sequel can't be far behind from this underrated animated flick. Nevertheless, it certainly kept me laughing nearly throughout the movie's 90-minute run time and it's something that shouldn't be taken for granted. I enjoyed it."
7,A good mix between toy story and bolt,18 June 2016,"A great film with good humour and likable characters If your going to watch this film, watch it for the rabbit Kevin Hart kills it as the over the top villain The soundtrack is also very good, it fits the film well Lenord takes your stereotypical views of poodles and flips it the other way The constant fight between cats and dogs is funny And, I won't spoil it but there is an awesome fight scene at the end There are classic animation sad moments The plot is also good it starts of like toy story with a new dog coming home from the pound and the original and the new dogs do not agree to say the least. The two end up fighting and get caught by the pest control in the process due to a gang of cats. The get broken out by a bunny rabbit and his goons (a pig and a lizard) and briefly become friends until the rabbit finds out the two dogs have an owner. Then they go on the run with the rabbit and his gang close behind. Meanwhile gidget and the rest of the pets in the block realise max is gone and try to find him. With the help of an old dog and a birds they get to max and duke just in time to stop the gang from killing them both. Before this max found out that duke had an owner before Katie, and when they realise they are near his old house so the try's to get duke confront his old owner when they get there they find out that a new family live there and duke old owner has died. Then duke gets caught by pet control again (who have also been after the two) , also caught are snowballs friends the pig and lizard so max and him Join forces to take down the pet control, which they do, but push the van off the edge of the Brooklyn bridge in the process. The pig and the lizard escape. It takes a little while to save duke but they do in the end. And they all go home No seriously, the bunny rabbit It is mind blowing Also to answer the question of someone in the message board, there is a Guini pig"
10,"Well written, enjoyable movie",10 July 2016,"I was thoroughly entertained by this movie. The writing was excellent, made my wife, youngest son, and myself constantly laugh, which isn't always easy for all 3 of us, simultaneously. The character development for these characters was interesting, as we were shown many facets of their psyche, which made it even more entertaining. I was waiting for the spot in the movie that would make me roll my eyes, as I find in most animated movies I have previously viewed, but it never happened. The adding of the little Minions vignette was hilarious to me, but not my family, which is fine, especially since I haven't seen either one of the Despicable movies, nor the Minion movie. A great family movie, 10 out of a 10 for me was a must...!!"
9,Fun Family film,30 July 2016,"Very fun and entertaining movie for the whole family, lots of laughs and surprises. My 3 year old (also named Chloe) actually behaved throughout the whole movie, of which she was also holding on to her stuffed Chloe Doll that she picked up earlier that afternoon. After the movie she commented that their were two Chloe's now. For a movie that didn't have a lot of media attention I am glad I took the family to see it and it was money well spent, fun for the whole family. My favorite part would have to be the one that they show in the trailers, such as when the poodle switches the music from classical to heavy metal. There I think that is ten lines."
10,The best kids movie this side of the summer,10 July 2016,"If you are looking for a movie full of dramatic moments; slow pace and sadness; that basically bore your kids but make the critics praise as a masterpiece; stop reading and go to see some PIXAR / Disney movie (like Dory or Zootopia) and watch your kids get impatient to get out of the cinema. If on the other hand; you want your kids to laugh non-stop for about 90 minutes and you enjoy with them; then do not loose one minute, get tickets for the Secret Life of Pet and start laughing on the first minute with the Minions short and keep doing it short until the very end of titles. There is some moral message about friendship, trust and love; but it will be guilty pleasure laugh and a few suspenseful moments.***SPOILER AHEAD**** Word of advice and possible spoiler; Snowball (the rabbit) is the most twisted character seen lately in movies; it can easily be part of an horror movie; but as played by Kevin Hart; it is historically funny whenever on screen. The same can be said for Gidget (played by Jenny Slate); her transition from a white sweet puppy to a dangerous and terrifying fighter is another of the top moments of the movie. ****END OF SPOILER****In brief; it will not win any Oscars; but is still the funniest movie of the summer."
10,"A great movie for kids, greatly animated, AMAZING music, great story line, FUNNY!",9 July 2016,"Amazing. The trees were all vibrant colors, the pets had amazing animation. The city itself was so detailed I wondered how long it took to make. The water flows so nicely. The jokes were hilarious, tons of kids (and adults) laughed and giggled the whole time. Although seeming very intense at times, the music flows great and goes great with the story line. This movie teaches a slight bit of friendship, and adaptation. I rate this 10/10 because I find it very understandable, laughable, and friendly. All in all, a great movie to watch with the whole family. Also, each character has its own personality which adds to the movie!"
10,"Will do for pets, what Toy Story did for toys",5 August 2016,"Well known Pets are friends in the neighborhood, until one incident separates two dogs from there owner, there friends who are also pets must band together to find them.The movie makes you realize the joy of having a pet, made me remember my dog who passed away years ago. The voice actors really do well with there characters. It's a fun adventure and misadventure also. The animation is amazing, not Toy Story amazing, but amazing. Awesome to see all kinds of animals working together. Kids and adults I believe will enjoy this. Will make really enjoy owning a pet, and what a pet means to you."
1,Steaming Pile,22 August 2016,"This movie seemed like it was written by a team of writers under the conditions that 1) they include no funny jokes; 2)put as many clichés as possible about pets, and 3) write it in less than 24 hours. It was AWFUL. Nothing made sense, none of the characters are likable, and the antagonist's plot line is DARK (at one point they ask about the details of how the main characters killed their human masters and the villain seems to take pleasure that they killed them with a blender). There's also some weirdly racist line from Kevin Hart about a raccoon lying about being the President. I've seen a lot of animated movies that are great for kids but adults can also enjoy. This is not one of them."
10,I Always Wondered What My Dog was Thinking!,2 August 2016,"Max is your ordinary terrier who loves his mistress Katie and he waits with baited breath for her return every night from work. His friends also wait for their owners, but not with the dedication Max has! Leonard, a large poodle plays rock music when his proper owner who loves classical goes to work, while Chloe a rather snobby cat pushes away her bowl of cat food when her owner goes to work. Gidget a small white dog who loves Max watches soaps while a pet bird pretends he is a fighter plane. Everything in Max's world with Katie changes when she brings home a large brown dog named Duke who steals Max's bed and food. Max wants Duke out of the picture and in the real world when the dog walker Katie hires doesn't do his job right, Max seems to get his wish. However,things turn out bad when Max along with Duke get picked up as strays and it is up to Chloe and Gidget to get them back. Chloe and Gidget hire a scavenger bird and a crazed white bunny named Snowball to get Max and Duke back. This is a very funny story about the way our pets see the world and how they see us! Max learns to love Duke even though he doesn't want to share his owner with him and both are lucky to have Katie in their lives. I recommend this movie to all pet owners!"
8,"Pets on the Run, Make for Silly, Family Fun",9 July 2016,"Kids movies continue to swarm into the theaters, and Hollywood's trailer editors have been hard at work baiting us in. With Disney owning the box office this summer, Illumination Entertainment (the creators of Despicable Me) are taking a shot at the box office run. This weekend we got The Secret Life Of Pets, a movie that has been highly anticipated since it's trailer debut from so long ago. It was indeed a very entertaining trailer, but we all know how trailers can be deceptive now don't we? So I have headed into the trenches again to report on the latest film to hit the silver screen. The GOOD  Cute/Kid Friendly  Funny  Good animationWhen you watch, or for many rewatch, the trailers you most likely saw the characters as cute, cuddly animals doing hilarious things. Good news! The trailer is accurate this time and provides the cute factor you expected (including the very scenes you saw in the trailer). All of the characters are adorable, the main ones being bouncy, fluffy, high-spirited animals that will make you want to say Awwwwww. Our design team found a way to maximize all the cute features of an animal and sell it to the families that will lead to merchandising. Even animals you wouldn't think cute (like snakes, gators, and lizards) get the cuddly personifications. Hopefully you have gathered from this, that the design is kid friendly and will have your little ones enamored. But cute is only the hook, what keeps the interest going in this film? The answer is the comedy of course. The stunts the animals pull are entertaining and the dialogue itself had me chuckling at many of the media references. Voice acting only helps sell the comedy more, especially Kevin Hart and all his high pitched screaming. Your kids though will be the ones to enjoy the comedy the most though, as it is slapstick, simplistic antics with digital pets. Running into walls, making funny faces, or going to the bathroom on the floor are just some of the things you will see that had toddlers chuckling in their seats. And a small bonus, that really shouldn't be a surprise, is that the animation is good. Illumination Entertainment certainly has their anatomy and physiology down being able to superimpose human qualities while still maintaining there animal qualities. Glad to know that our animation studios are still able to produce great works. If only they could have put that effort into the next few qualities. THE BAD  The Story  Lack of Uniqueness  Trailers showed you a lot of the movieWith the comedy and animation being the obvious focus, you have to wonder how the story fared in this movie. Unfortunatelyit didn't fare that well. Oh it's not that bad at all, but the problem is that it lacks anything memorable or emotionally driving for me. The writers crammed a lot of plots into a short 90 minutes run time, and the resulting production was a very rushed, shallow tale with little development. A split focus resulted in little emotional build-up, and there was no intriguing qualities to keep my attention on any of the cast. And the goal they were trying to achieve was very limited and didn't really set any time limit or urgency to the tale. To add more fuel to that fire, The Secret Life of Pets wasn't really that unique of a movie. We've had talking pet movies before, where anthropomorphic animals traverse a city or town that often involves a very extreme villain (think Oliver and Company or Homeward Bound). Those tales stick home because they had edge, depth, and moments that stick out in your mind. Not the case with this movie, as again there was no drive to make our pets grow, develop, or even go through much struggle at all. It doesn't have any twists to mix things up either, and therefore leaves little to spoilt. In addition, much of the movie, including a lot of the funny parts, is revealed in the three trailers out and therefore you can save yourself some major bucks by just rewatching all of the trailers. Yeah, I know that is definitely a disappointing factor. The VerdictThe Secret Life Of Pets is exactly what the trailer promises, fun, entertaining, and wildly adorable. Younger audience members, as well as those very young at heart, are the target group for this movie hands down. It has the laugh factor certainly, and the cast of characters are a motley crew that I certainly enjoyed. However, the story is very simplistic, the lack of emotional suspense, and that much of the movie is told in the trailers make this movie not the most memorable of the summer. I can't say it is worth a trip to the theater in comparison to some of the other kid movies, but it makes for a good family outing. My scores are:Animation/Comedy/Family: 7.5-8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0"
8,A fun movie with a good plot.,3 July 2016,"I enjoyed this movie more than Despicable Me. I liked the fact that there was more than one story going on at a time. At one point, there were three different stories that eventually came together.I think the jokes in the movie would be funnier for adults than children, probably because I'm a fan of Louis C.K. and his delivery. I think the eventual happy ending that concludes the movie is suited to the kids and they will come out happy they saw it.The characters aren't as compelling as Disney/Pixar characters but I think there were more jokes in this one than usual. I also don't think there were as much emotional obstacles for the characters to conquer in this one opposed to a Disney/Pixar movie. This movie was just fun almost all the way through. Even when the characters were about to die they were still making jokes. Some people might rather this type of animation.The movie was easy and fun to watch, a good movie for the kids and the adults."
9,Loved it! Completely funny and silly,1 July 2016,"I could not wait to see The Secret Life of Pets and I was not disappointed! I LOVED it! The Secret Life of Pets is an animated comedy that is both funny and sincere. It is about a dog named Max (Louis C.K.), his new brother Duke (Eric Stonestreet) and their friends. Max doesn't like Duke so he does things that he hopes will get him kicked out of the family home. One day Max comes up with an idea that he hopes will get Duke taken away. His idea backfires and causes Max and Duke to get caught and almost sent to the pound. Will Max and Duke get home? Will their friends find them and help them get home? My favorite character is Gidget (Jenny Slate) who is a white little dog who likes Max. She is very sweet and kind, but when it comes to helping her friends, she will fight anyone. This is a funny trait of Gidget's because she is a super sweet dog but she will fight to protect her loved ones.My favorite scene is when Duke and Max are in a wiener factory and there is a little song where the hot dogs come to life. Little kids might not like this scene because the singing hot dogs get eaten by Duke and Max and they eat the hot dog's heads off.Though there are many morals to this movie, the most important is ""Do not judge someone before you get to know them."" Max doesn't like Duke when he first comes, but later on he learns to appreciate him. The Secret Life of Pets is a funny cartoon about cute animals, but it may not appeal to younger audiences. There are some scenes that might be too scary for little kids. Also, Max and Duke say this to save their lives but, be forewarned they do say ""put their owner in the blender.""I recommend The Secret Life of Pets for kids ages 5 to 15 due to the scary scenes. Older audiences may like this movie if they love animals and fun cartoons. I rate this movie 5 out of 5 stars because it is entertaining and about my favorite subject...animals!Reviewed by Mia A., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic."
9,Illumination does it again!!,6 August 2016,The Secret Life of Pets (2016) is probably one of Illuminations best. Not being a huge fan of Minions (2015) I was happy that Illumination and Universal Pictures could pull off another good project just like the first Despicable Me (2010). The Secret Life of Pets (2016) is a fun lighthearted animation comedy aimed more towards younger children. One of the main characters named snowball (Kevin Hart) can be quite scary towards more sensitive younger viewers but his behavior is all comedic. It is great but not the highlight of the summer. Movies like Central Intelligence (2016) and Finding Dory (2016) took the top spots though. The movie is a bit of fun for families with younger children who want a 90 minute film with plenty of giggles and smiles. Louis C.K plays Max the main protagonist and Eric Stonestreet plays Duke the co-protagonist. All in all The Secret Life of Pets gives viewers a fun and energetic movie.
8,Very silly but enjoyable,13 July 2016,Animated film that takes place in NYC. Two dogs named Max (voiced by Louis C.K.) and Duke (voiced by Eric Stonestreet) get separated from their owner when out for a walk. The film chronicles their journey back home.This is clearly aimed at kids but has plenty of humor that adults will enjoy. I'm in my 50s and laughed long and loud at some of the antics. The script is good and moves quickly. I was never bored. With one exception the voices perfectly fit the characters. The one exception was Snowball. He's a psychotic rabbit voiced by Kevin Hart. Hart can be funny but not here. He YELLS every word out at the audience. It gets annoying quick. The animation is great--very fluid and pleasing to the eye. The backdrops of NYC are breath-taking. The only real debit is there are some glaring lapses in logic but it IS a kids film. Recommended.
8,"Don't keep it to yourself - ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is great family fun!",9 July 2016,"When you see as many movies as I do (and you start writing reviews in your head while you're watching them), certain movies, parts of movies, plot points or characters remind you of other movies. In my reviews, I often note those parallels, using them to comment on the movie I'm reviewing. Sometimes I note similarities between movies to say that the more recent film is unoriginal. Other times, it's just to help explain what the new movie is like. The animated adventure comedy ""The Secret Life of Pets"" (PG, 1:30) reminds me very much of two other animated features but that's not necessarily a bad thing.Tell me if this sounds familiar: Someone's possessions (as he or she views them) actually have secret lives of their own which are only really apparent when the owner is not around. These anthropomorphic possessions relate to each other and form friendships. When a newer version of the original is brought into the group, jealousy emerges and the original tries to get rid of the interloper. This struggle results in both of the rivals being thrust out of the comforts of home into the little-understood big, bad world, a situation which requires their compadres to venture out of their own comfort zones to mount a rescue.That set-up fits Illumination Entertainment's 2016 ""The Secret Life of Pets"" as well as it does the 1995 Pixar/Disney classic film ""Toy Story"". (Think, ""Pet Story"", or ""The Secret Life of Toys"".) But considering that the 2016 film is about animals rather than toys, maybe the better comparison is to another 2016 animated feature (also from Disney) by the name of ""Zootopia"". In both of those 2016 films, a couple of anthropomorphic animals (among many others living in a big city) form a partnership which develops into a mutually beneficial friendship. I guess it's not unfair to think of ""The Secret Life of Pets"" as a mash-up of ""Toy Story"" and ""Zootopia"". Nevertheless, this one charts its own unique course and is as entertaining as those other two or the ""Despicable Me"" films, also from Illumination Entertainment.Now that you know what ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is LIKE, here's what it's ABOUT: The movie focuses on a small brown and white terrier named Max (voiced by Louis C.K.) and his relationship with the other pets in his apartment building. Max lives in a small Manhattan apartment with his owner, a young woman named Katie (Ellie Kemper). When Katie goes to work each day, Max sits at the door wondering where she has gone and waiting for her to come back and play with him. Meanwhile, the pets in the building across the alley and above and below his apartment (and one guniea pig lost in the air ducts) are more active in their daily lives (and more mobile) than is readily apparent. (Thus, the title of the film.) Some of the neighborhood pets include an overweight white cat named Chloe (Lake Bell), a bulldog named Mel (Bobby Moynihan), a dachshund named Buddy (Hannibal Buress), a canary named Sweet Pea (Tara Strong), and Gidget (Jenny Slate), a white Pomeranian who has a secret crush on Max.Except for missing Katie during the day, all is well in Max's little world until one not-so-fine day when Katie brings home another dog she rescued from a shelter. Duke (Eric Stonestreet) is a large, shaggy, dark brown dog who has no problem throwing his weight around to get the best place to sleep, or as much food as he wants, or anything else. Max starts scheming about how to get rid of Duke, but one such attempt while they're in the park with Katie's dog walker back-fires and sets both Max and Duke off on a wild and dangerous journey around the city. When Gidget realizes that Max has disappeared, she enlists their mutual pet friends, plus a caged hawk named Tiberius (Albert Brooks), and a few other neighborhood pets (including the Dana Carvey voiced ""Pops""), to help her find Max. Meanwhile, Max and Duke have to try escaping from animal control workers, a disfigured alley cat named Ozone (Steve Coogan) and a small, but crazed and bitter bunny named Snowball (Kevin Hart), who was discarded by the magician he worked for and now leads a sewer-dwelling group of radicals called The Flushed Pets, who are bent on wiping out all the humans – and who decide that Max and Duke are also their enemies.""The Secret Life of Pets"" is every bit as entertaining as you'd hope, based on its theatrical trailers, or its movie posters, or just its title. Co-writers Cinco Paul, Ken Daurio and Brian Lynch exploit many of the well-known quirks of different kinds of pets, but give each character in the film its own personality. Then, once the script clearly establishes who each of these characters are, it gives them plenty to do, but without making the story unnecessarily complicated. Co-directors Chris Renaud (who also voices the aforementioned lost guinea pig) and Yarrow Cheney bring this promising concept and excellent script to realization by keeping the plot moving and not overdoing any of the film's big ideas or overplaying any of the gags. Finally, with the film's impressive voice cast and the filmmakers' ""Despicable"" history, the performances and the visuals are excellent across the board. On the critical side, I found a subplot involving Duke's backstory and a ""Grease""-inspired sausage-fueled dream sequence to be odd and unnecessary diversions, and I would've liked to see just a little more originality and inspiration sprinkled throughout the movie. However, there's no denying that ""The Secret Life of Pets"" is very well-done good, clean fun for the whole family. ""A-"""
8,Fun Movie starring Pets,15 July 2016,"Kevin Hart steals this one - he's hilarious as bunny, Snowball - leader of the pack! As is the falcon, Pops (Dana Carvey), and of course Louis CK as Max. Enjoyable romp for kids and grandmas (ME!) Wiener Kingdom sequence is a hoot, funny; love the animal expressions. Some have criticized the manic pace, but I didn't find it particularly ""manic"" - animated movies have to be in constant motion to keep attention. My 2 and 4 year old grandsons enjoyed it, 4 year old was laughing out loud at all the silliness; as was their Mommy and Grandma. Guess I'll be spending lots of time going to kids' movies this summer, as the rest of the summer movies are more of the same old retreads. Talking pets who get into a bunch of trouble and are rescued by an odd assortment of other animals! Cute and fun."
10,An instant classic,11 July 2016,"Just saw this hilarious, heartwarming and inspiring movie with my grandchildren. The jam- packed theater was literally rocking with the joyous giggles and laughter of the children. However, at times, the kids' delighted outbursts were overwhelmed by the raucous guffaws of adults appreciating the keen, sophisticated sense of humor of the director. As a native New Yorker, I was especially impressed that an animated film could truly capture the essence and heart of our wonderful city. I wasastinished to see so many people leaving the theater getting right back on line to purchase tickets for future performances; as dozens of people had been turned away from this showing and those for the remainder of the weekend . This is a wholesome, must-see movie for pet lovers and children of all ages! Don't miss it!"
9,Pet Lover's Delight,13 July 2016,"It's a ""Despicable Me"" reunion (don't let that turn you away), as director Chris Renaud, writers Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio, along with director Yarrow Cheney (How the Grinch Stole Christmas, 2018) gather to get inside the hearts and minds of our little furry/scaly/feathered friends. With fun music by Alexandre Desalt (The Danish Girl 2015), a list of Who's Who cool VO actors (Louis C.K., Eric Stonestreet, Kevin Hart, Dana Carey, Jenny Slate, Ellie Kemper, Albert Brooks, Lake Bell - the list goes on), and realistic animation courtesy of Illumination Entertainment, new, old and foreseeable pet owners (young and mature) will find great delight in this easy and entertaining to watch animation production. To the credit of the writers, all the obvious ""pet jokes/mannerisms"" and current society references aren't forced on the viewer at one time. Thus, the film keeps giving throughout. Sure, about 3/4 the way in the idea grows a bit old, but the cuteness factor quickly returns for a rewarding finish. FYI: Don't let the less than funny ""DM"" Short that pre-empetes the film cloud your judgment. While Children (and there are plenty in attendance) really enjoy all things ""DM,"" there were few adults enjoying that experience. Illumination Entertainment is pre- viewing ""Sing,"" due out in 2016, which also looks promising. Ruff, Ruff!"
9,The secret life of pets,28 July 2016,"Whenever I got invited on a date to go watch this movie, I was kind of skeptical at first because it was a cartoon film and I haven't even watched the trailer. But whatever, free movie and yummy popcorn right? To say the least, this movie took me off guard and laughed so much at the roles the characters had. It was such an adorable movie. Even though it was a kids movie, it had clues here and there about things adults would do and even say. Which made it even funnier! I couldn't give a bad review on this because I genuinely had a great time watching it. I definitely recommend it to anyone, including kids and adults as well Even if it's a cartoon film, it's definitely the kind to wait and hope for a second version."
10,A great animated film for all pet lovers,27 July 2016,"I got curious about this movie after seeing the trailers. Then my mom and I saw it in the theatre; I thought it is another great animated movie of the year. Also Max & Gidget are my favorite characters.The story is about Max living a good life in his New York apartment with his beloved owner Katie. That is until Katie brings home a big, shaggy stray name Duke, who Max thought is trying to muscle in on his happy home. One day during a walk with the dog-walker, the resentive Duke tricks Max into travelling far into the city, and they are attacked by a feral cat gang in an alley. The cats remove Max and Duke's collars and the dogs are caught by the city's Animal Control. Fortunately the two dogs were saved by a rogue band called ""The Flushed Pets"". That is all I could tell you folks.I don't have a favorite scene (as I said many times), because I love the whole film from beginning to end. I also love the movie's humor and great animation. One more thing to point out is that Max was so cute as a puppy! So overall, this is a great film for all pet lovers."
10,Got Pets? - Ya HAVE to see it! - Got Kids? - Ya HAVE to see it !,27 July 2016,"Fast-paced and Funny! Lots of Laughs and action ..... The good guys always win! ..... This out does Disney by far Not too scary for kids, scenes move and change fast, so their little minds don't really grasp the couple of sad parts .....Attention is fixed on their Brooklyn adventure underground .. Great voice-overs, each character comes through as an individual, so you can pick your favorite ""PAL""... Our theater was full of laughter almost all the way through ... except when the kids were cheering for the pets as they managed to outsmart Animal Control .. It's always fun when a rag-tag group of mis-fits out smarts the bad guys..Most of the pets are available through local toy stores with the exception of ""Tatoo"" the pig ... why he is not included seems to be an oversight on the part of the studio.. Not that he had a major role but nonetheless he was still an intregal part to the plot No matter which your favorite pet is in the movie, it was well written and deserves to be seen by all"
6,Never pets were so funny and addictive,17 July 2016,"Hallelujah! It took so many time to see a movie that take my illusion in animated comedies back. Funny,fresh and sassy. Though I'm not a fan of comediesA topic so easy to make a movie, but that never was made. And that's exactly what makes this movie so amazing. The simpleness that with hilarious touches that you don's see coming. The variety of animals and situations that puts them in topics and scenes easy to success is one of the best points of this movie.One of the best comedies of the year for just been just like it is and don't create atypical situation that animated movies got us used to.And once again show us that less is more and maybe not perfect but high enough to have an amazing time.This movie makes something that almost no one does, make me laugh almost the whole movie"
10,Fantastic movie for all ages! Everyone should watch this film!,2 September 2016,"-Looking for a great movie, that's hilarious? This movie is heart warming,its a very fun watch that you can enjoy alone or with someone (turn off the light-close the blinds get your loved ones,treats and cuddle up for a great time!)- I thought this was a great film! It was so very well done from the story line and brilliantly written and quite humorous script! To the gorgeous animation that is stunningly executed. Consistently complimenting the very creatively and carefully crafted characters that you will instantly fall in love with and keep you smiling and laughing through out the film! The cast and voicing worked well with the beautiful illustration to really brought the characters and movie to life! Ultimately bringing the whole movie home.It doesn't matter if your 5 or 50 just be happy and enjoy the simple things in life ( the things that actually matter ;) -Take Care World & God Bless!"
7,The studios best film since Despicable Me,18 June 2016,"With the animation genre in such a golden age, more and more studios are starting to drop their name into the mix.The latest one is Illumination Entertainment. After starting really well with Despicable Me, it has seemed to have made OK flicks such as Hop, The Lorax, Despicable Me 2 and Minions.Now we have what many people are hyping as their best feature since Despicable Me, in the form The Secret Life Of Pets. The marketing has been pretty good and trailer suggests a good time at the cinema.For me, I was pretty satisfied with what I saw. The first third of the film was its strongest part. It was introducing the characters well, there were some solid laughs and they were setting up the story nicely. However the longer the film went on, the slightly sillier it was getting. It was starting to lose its feet, and the gags were getting a bit too much. Thankfully, it was not that bad at all on the whole. It was still moving a long nicely, the characters were being solidly developed and the story rounded off pretty well. I think it might have peaked too soon and everything else felt inferior.The voice performances were good. Jenny Slate continues to do well in her voice work and I felt she gave the strongest performance. Kevin Hart played his character really well, and had some nice laughs. Louis C.K. was well cast as the lead and gave us a character you could root for. The rest did their job well. They were not good enough to be memorable, but not bad enough to be negatively criticised.On the technical side, the animation looked really nice and fitted the tone well. The action was entertaining if not a bit over the top at times. The character designs were strong, and I can see them being sold well as merchandise.Overall, some of it felt disappointing. But on the whole I had a fairly good time watching this. It is definitely the studio's best film since Despicable Me. But with so many other animation studios delivering much stronger films at the moment, this could be forgotten sooner than you think. This might not do as well in the box office as originally expected. Especially a new Pixar film on the way.There is also a short before the main film, and it features the studios most famous characters. It was o.k. But nowhere near as strong as Pixar's shorts."
9,Illumination's Answer to Toy Story,8 July 2016,"When well-developed setups lead to brilliantly executed gags, throw in some adorable house pets and endearing street animals and you get Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainment's answer to what toys do when the owners aren't around, The Secret Life of Pets. More precisely, this movie could be described as Toy Story meets Oliver and Company meets Homeward Bound. Backed by an exquisitely talented cast of voice actors and excellent writing, The Secret Life of Pets could be what ushers Illumination Entertainment (an NBCU company) into the ring with Disney- Pixar. Prior to this movie, Illumination/Universal certainly created some fantastic animated films including The Lorax, Despicable Me, and others; but this film is the first to really be on par with the Disney-Pixar quality that many of us have come to love and expect. Fast-paced and comedically timed very well, this movie is sure to entertain and warm the hearts of anyone who sits down to watch it. Is it quite as endearing as Toy Story? Not exactly; but it is very close and serves as evidence that we should come to expect this quality and higher of animation from Universal/Illumination. Although the movie is marketed to kids and teenagers, there is certainly enough comedic subtext, easter eggs, and nods to films that adults will greatly appreciate as well. One of my personal favorites is in the Millions short film before the feature. One of the minions is wearing a hat that states ""let it grow"" while he's cutting the grass.When Max (Louis C.K.), a spoiled terrier living in a New York City apartment building with a beautiful view meets his new roommate, his perfect world is rocked. New roommate Duke (Eric Stonestreet), a giant rambunctious dog, mixes as well with Max as oil does with water. They are complete opposites in nearly every way. Max soon gets the idea to set Duke up for failure by sabotaging the house. Unfortunately that idea backfires and just serves to stoke the fire of animosity. After a prank in the park takes a turn for the worst, both Max and Duke are lost in the seedy underbelly of New York City. The Secret Life of Pets' success is in-part due to the successful setup and payoff of gags. This can be a dangerous platform on which to build an animated comedy because there is a high risk of the narrative primarily resting upon the gags instead of the gags enhancing the diegesis. Fortunately for audiences, this film successfully pairs a well-developed and paced narrative that will keep your attention and deliver laughs for the entire runtime. Sometimes comedies, whether animated or live action, can spend too much time in the development of gags rather than on the visual storytelling. For instance, some movies write the gags first and then try to integrate a story that attempts to tie all of them together. What I appreciate about The Secret Life of Pets is the strong story inclusive of sight gags and double entendre humor to satisfy a diverse audience from different backgrounds and ages. In addition to the writing, the vocal talents are also instrumental in the success of this animated feature. Leading the ""pack"" are of course comedians Louis C.K. and Kevin Hart, but the entire cast is perfectly pairs with his or her animated persona. For the cat lovers out there (and yes, I am one of them), there are deftly come good comedic jabs at dogs. But the dogs also get in some good ones on the cats. Haha.The setting of the movie is New York City, or an idealistic surreal New York City slightly augmented to fit the pacing, genre, and feeling of the film. I'd like to know what job Katie has to be able to live by herself in an apartment with such a beautiful view. But I suppose it's just as well that we don't since the focus is on the dogs. On the view from the apartment, though. Much like the view from Frasier's upscale urban trend-setting apartment in Seattle faced a view of the Seattle skyline that doesn't actually exist, unless you are looking at downtown from the surrounding mountains and hills, I am not entirely sure the view from Katie's Manhattan apartment exists either. The view of the city seen from Frasier's apartment was selected in order for the Space Needle to have a prominent placement in the skyline. In the same vein, I believe that the unrealistic view from Katie's apartment was selected in order for the Freedom Tower to have a strong presence. I know, I am analyzing an element that doesn't really have an affect upon the film; but since the film is actually very well done, I thought it would be fun to look at the setting of the movie.Although I can almost guarantee you that his film won't see an Oscar nom in the animated feature category, much less a win, since the Academy believes that only Pixar can create Oscar-worthy animated films, I find The Secret Life of Pets to be a fantastic animated feature filled with action, adventure, comedy, and some touching moments as well. All around, it is enjoyable for the whole family and will cause many owners to wonder what their pet does while he or she is away at work. One of my favorite parts of the movie is the musical sequence at the sausage factory. So much symbolism to discuss. Haha. So, yes. This movie even includes a musical number worthy of–I am sure–many memes to come over the next few months."
1,More Trash from Illumination Entertainment,8 May 2017,"""The Secret Life of Pets"" is a movie from the film studio Illumination Entertainment, whose biggest claim to fame has been the creations of the abominable minions from ""Despicable Me."" When little yellow creatures that speak gibberish are your studio's biggest highlight, it's no wonder their film turned out like this.""The Secret Life of Pets"" is essentially all three ""Toy Story"" movies rolled into one movie with three separate plot lines. The first movie about two rival toys who earn to respect and work with each other is given to the main characters of Max (Louis C.K.) and Duke (Eric Stonestreet). The second movie, where it focuses on all of the secondary characters from the first movie on a mission to save Woody, is showcased with the character Gidget (Jenny Slate) rounding up pets to look for Max and Duke. The antagonist of the movie, a white bunny named Snowball (Kevin Hart) has the same character and motivation as Lots-o-Huggin bear from ""Toy Story 3.""With no original story elements, you'd think there would be an attempt to make the characters likable and engaging to watch, but no. Max and Duke start out as unlikable, and only become likable when they inexplicably begin working together. It makes sense that in one scene they would set aside their differences, but after that there is no reason for them to be working together. Then, they suddenly like each other without any reason to. Gidget is no better, as she dumbly trusts a hawk (Albert Brooks) who was clearly making threats to eat her, but the story must go on. Snowball sums up these idiotic and lazy character moments in one scene where, after trying to kill Max, says, ""We need to work together now,"" and then everything is suddenly put behind them.Character stupidity is a big propeller of the plot, but pure coincidence is too. Almost no story elements feel like they organically happened, and instead feel contrived or tossed in to make the screenwriter's job easier. Take this for example, New York City is a big place (especially for animals who mostly don't know the city except for what's right outside of their apartments), yet everyone makes their way onto one of New York's bridges for the climax of the movie without having any reason to know that Max and Snowball are there, and thus giving them reason to be there.To put it in simple terms, this movie is lazy with its characters, uninspired with its story, and unfunny with its comedy. The only thing I can really say in its defense is that the story could at least be followed."
10,Excellent movie for family,19 September 2016,"I was waiting for this movie since first trailer was launched. And when i had opportunity to watch it, i was more than happy. Great story line, It was funny silly and my favorite illumination movie it's worth a watch and it is definitely better than minions it is fun for the whole family. I could not stop laughing at this movie it so many great characters. Very fun and entertaining movie for the whole family, this movie took me off guard and laughed so much at the roles the characters had. It was such an adorable movie.A Jack Russell Terrier named Max lives with his owner Katie in a Manhattan apartment. While she is at work during the day, he hangs out with other pets in the building: tabby cat Chloe, pug dog Mel, dachshund dog Buddy, and budgerigar birb Sweetpea. One day, Katie adopts Duke, the big brown dog from the pound, leaving Max jealous because of her larger focus on Duke. One day, because of attitude max toward Duke, the duke draped Max to alley and abandon Max there; however, they are both attacked by a gang of alley cats led by Sphynx cat Ozone. The cats remove both dogs' collars and leave them to be caught by Animal Control. They are rescued by a rabbit named Snowball, the leader of ""The Flushed Pets""– a gang of sewer-dwelling animals who hate humans. After Max and Duke pretend to despise humans as much as they do, the Flushed Pets invite them to join. Before they can prove their loyalty to Snowball, The two dogs escape the sewers. Snowball vows to kill them and leads the Flushed Pets after them.A white dog who has a crush on Max, discovers that he is missing, and recruits red-tailed hawk, Gidget (the white dog) and Tiberius (the hawk) then enlist Mel (The fat dog), Buddy(a sarcastic dachshund dog), Chloe(a gray cat), guinea pig Norman(a guinea pig), Sweetpea(a small birb), and a paralyzed old base hound named Pops to begin searching Max. The group encounters Snowball, who vows to kill them as well, and Norman (a guinea pig) is captured as the rest of Gidget(the white dog )'s team flees. In Brooklyn, Max and Duke begin to get along with each other. Duke tells Max about his previous owner, Fred, an elderly man, live with him with happy life. One day, Duke got lost while chasing a butterfly and was picked up by Animal Control. Max convinces him to visit Fred's house in a nearby neighborhood, confident that Fred will still love him. When they arrive, though, they learn from a resident cat named Reginald that Fred has died. Resentful and angry, Duke accuses Max of attempting to get rid of him and barks at the new homeowners who call Animal Control. The handlers catch Max, but Duke interferes for him to escape and ends up being captured instead. While trying to rescue Duke as he follows the Animal Control van, Max is attacked by Snowball and his comrades. However, Snowball's gang are captured by animal control, and Snowball decides to help Max rescue them. They drive by a city bus and crash into the van of animal control on the Brooklyn Bridge, stopping traffic. The animal control van falls into the East River with Max and Duke inside. Max is unable to get the keys to Duke's cage, so Snowball jumps into the river to retrieve them, allowing Max and Duke to escape the sinking van. The entire group return to the apartment by taxi. Max expresses his appreciation toward Gidget. Snowball and the Flushed Pets then come up with a new plan to annihilate all humans, but Snowball is then adopted by a little girl named Molly. At first, Snowball resists, but gives in to her sweetness and lets himself be adopted by her. Max and Duke finally reunite with Katie, sparking a true friendship."

Anyway I Give the The Secret Life of Pets a 10 for being cute & Funny.
10,Secret life of pets,18 July 2016,"The Secret Life Of Pets was one of those animated movies that you just don't want to miss because it is that good of a movie. You and your family will love the non stop animation that your kids will love the whole time. This is such a cool movie for the whole family it was unbelievable. This movie will make your kids laugh the whole way through because if they like pets then they will absolutely love this movie it was stupendous fantastic spectacular just wonderful you need to see this once in a life time experience Parents this is perfect for the kids. Duke is played by the same actor who plays cam on Modern family and he is FLAT OUT Hilarious, Also KEVIN HART WAS FLAT OUT Hilarious. Evan Louis C.K. Was FLAT OUT Hilarious. I just think that this was the funniest movie of the year besides Popstar Never Stop Never Stopping."
8,"An absolutely fun film, that the whole family will enjoy.",12 July 2016,"The Secret Life of Pets tells the story of a pet dog named, Max(Louis C.K.). Max's owner Katie(Ellie Kemper) brings home a stray dog named, Duke(Eric Stonestreet). Duke's arrival, turns Max's normal life with Katie, upside down. Max & Duke dislike each other. Soon, Max & Duke put their differences aside, when they end up far away from home. Now, Max & Duke will have to work together, to find their way back home. The Secret Life of Pets is a movie, packed with adventure & hilarity. It is a great film. The animation is top-notch. The New York City skyline has been recreated, flawlessly. The 3D provides both depth & many eye-popping moments, throughout the movie. The makers of the film have perfectly represented the difference in behavior between pet dogs & cats, when it comes to the animals' opinion of their owners. The highlight of the film is the supremely talented voice cast, who breathe life into the lovable pets. Louis C.K. is spectacular as Max. Eric Stonestreet is outstanding as Duke. Kevin Hart is amazing as Snowball. Jenny Slate is awesome as Gidget. Ellie Kemper is impressive as Katie. Albert Brooks is excellent as Tiberius. Lake Bell is brilliant as Chloe. Dana Carvey is hilarious as Pops. Hannibal Buress & Bobby Moynihan are good as Buddy & Mel, respectively. The supporting cast is effective. The Secret Life of Pets is a must watch, for the entire family."
8,"Since its start, Universal has been America's Monster Movie Studio . . .",11 July 2016,". . . which makes THE SECRET LIFE OF PETS par for Universal's course. When most people think of monsters, Frankenstein, Dracula, Godzilla, and Hitler are among the first to come to mind. If you specify American monsters, Bigfoot, the Boogie Man, Candyman, and The Duke are on the tips of everyone's tongues. PETS cleverly provides animated documentation of Duke's decades-long rampage through American Life and Culture during the 1900s, as the usurper of U.S. dog Max's Home Sweet Home. (If you're not up on 1900s American History, a boy named Marion got depressed over his Ma running out on his dying Pa and renamed himself after the family mutt, as ""Duke (Mad Dog) Wayne."" Shortly thereafter, this struggling cheap-flick ""singing cowboy"" was recruited to the Dark Side by the American Fascist Party, where he literally fingered thousands of Real Life Working Stiffs for bankruptcy, political prisons, ""suicide,"" and premature death as the self-appointed U.S. Snitch-in-Chief.) In PETS, gluttonous Big Dawg Duke steals Max's food, bed, and mistress before turning Max over to dogcatchers. It would take an entire book to itemize all the tie-ins between PETS' plot and characters with America's All-Time Leading Monster, Duke ""Mad Dog"" Wayne."
9,Twizard Rating: 89,21 July 2016,"I'm not one to really gawk at the vocal cast of an animated film, but Illumination Entertainment (of Despicable Me fame) sure knows how to pick them.In their sixth motion picture, the studio gives us a peek at what our pets do when we're not home. It begins with Max (Louis C.K.), a small dog who loves his owner more than life itself. He stands in front of the door all day just waiting for her to come home. Then one day, she does, but brings in with her a very large dog named Duke (Eric Stonestreet).You may only get the jokes and the high-flying emotions if you have pets of your own. Luckily, most of America does in one way or another. Anyone who does knows how unbelievably ridiculous they can be sometimes. And this movie goes the route of exploiting that a bit, without actually trying to make sense of it--because, what fun would that be? Some may be bothered by the fact that it borrows from the premise of Toy Story--and a couple other Pixar gems. I'm not one of those. It's a smart move. And besides, there's much more to the story than just a simple two-misunderstood-individuals-journeying-home-together angle. There are multiple plots working at once.We don't just see Max and Duke trying to find their way back, but also a gang of Max's friends setting out to find him--led by a paralyzed blind dog and a spoiled rich dog who longs to profess her love for Max.There are some moments where it becomes very dark, but the issues come with how it handles those dark moments. It has a couple of chances--both of which it fails miserably.The energy never lets up, and that plays as more of a good thing than bad in The Secret Life of Pets. Your kids will love it and the laughter is pretty consistent from start to finish. It may not have the same emotional punch of Despicable Me, but it knows how to make us laugh, thoroughly showcasing the world that it wants us to see.Twizard Rating: 89"
8,"An improvement over Minions, but absolutely not perfect.",16 July 2016,"This film is from illumination entertainment, which recently created the first non Disney animated film to crack 1 Billion worldwide, Minions. For my thoughts on the studio, Despicable me 1, and 2 were great, Hop was OK, but forgettable, but The Lorax and especially Minions were bad. Then this film came along.Easily the weakest part is the writing. It rips off Toy Story using the same concept except with pets, which makes this movie very predictable, often in the first hour. It however, becomes a lot less predictable in the 3rd act, which gives it some suspense. This is also a problem with Independence day resurgence, but unlike that movie, the concept is well executed, which makes this movie entertaining. I had a good time watching it because of that. But overall, this writing is mediocre.The characters in this movie are one of my favorite parts. Max is, however the weaker one who is like Woody from Toy Story, who is a jerk to his companion at first, but then grows to be friends with him. The rest of the characters are all lovable and enjoyable to watch, suck as Duke, Gidget, Chloe, and more. But my favorite one is the bunny Snowball, who is the funniest, with Kevin Hart making a good performance as the bunny that looks cute but has a violent personality, making him the villain.New York City is one of my favorite cities in the world, and New York looks like nothing I've ever seen before. It perfectly shows all the attractions such as the One World Trade Center, Times square, Central Park, and Brooklin in way I've never seen in animation. Also, the design of the pets are accurate as they are both cute and well designed. The only part I don't like about the animation is the human design, which is always rather weak in Illumination movies. Along with this high quality animation, the humor hits a lot, with very smart gags, and not the very unfunny slapstick in Minions and it also takes a break from DreamWorks like Crass humor. There is an animated short that plays before this called ""Mower Minions"", which is OK and cute, its just that the humor isn't funny, just like the Minions film.The writing may be weak, but the film is enjoyable with memorable characters, and smart and funny gags. The animation is also breathtaking as heck. I recommend to kids and adults. It may not be as smart as Zootopia, or as unforgettable as Finding Dory, but it is a good addition to the summer."
8,The Secret Lives of Pets was quite a funny computer-animated feature film,13 July 2016,"In this Illumination (the makers of the Despicable Me series) computer-animated feature film, we see the animals talking after their owners leave for the day (just like the toys in the Toy Story series) and doing their own thing. The main character is a dog named Max who suddenly is being paired with a much bigger dog and he doesn't like it. I'll stop there and just say this was quite a funny and partly touching take on the ""animals on the loose in the city"" premise with many fine support from many of the other animals involved including a rabbit voiced by Kevin Hart. By the way, I was wonderfully surprised that among the other celebrities doing voices was one Albert Brooks who I previously also just heard reprising his Marlin fish character in Finding Dory. So on that note, I recommend The secret Lives of Pets."
8,Better than I thought it would be,10 July 2016,"Cute, funny, and not always predictable. I went to see this movie thinking it would just be funny. I expected it to be pointless, but the plot was pretty complex. The previews don't show you what it's really about. The story stayed exciting for the whole hour and a half. The characters were adorable and entertaining. The animation was pretty good, too. There are actually some scenes that make you feel like you're flying or falling even in 2-D. I wouldn't say this was *as good* as a Pixar movie, but it will definitely be on the list of nominees for best animated picture. I will add a warning: Do not bring children under the age of 5 unless they're pretty mature for their age and won't freak out. This is not mindless entertainment. There are crocodiles, monstrous snakes, and scary-looking killer cats, and there are scenes where it seems like a couple of the characters are going to die. A kid who looked to be about 2 screamed and cried at the more tense moments. This movie isn't graphic, but it will scare babies and very young kids. It's PG and not just G for a reason."
7,Cute and amusing in parts but ...,2 July 2016,"... it's not a classic. Has a nice family feel to it and kids will like it, but unlike some recent animations doesn't have much for adults. The gangsta rabbit is quite funny, and I wish that Claudia the fat cat had more lines as there was scope to develop that character a bit more. The plot is pretty thin but there again you don't really expect a lot more from this type of film. I quite liked it but was also a little disappointed - it was so hyped and unfortunately didn't really live up to it. I could watch Happy Feet and Shrek all day but I wouldn't want to sit through this again. But all in all it is what it is. It's aimed at children and they will enjoy it - my grandchildren aged 7 and 10 certainly did."
1,that is just terribly bad,28 June 2016,"I think I have never wrote any review before after I watched a bad movie, but this one managed to lower the bar to a level where I simply cannot hold it back.I was very much looking forward to this animation movie as the trailer was great and very promising (5 stars for the marketing people, they sold it).I don't even know where to start. It is not funny at all. It is so not funny that they had to repeat the only reasonable joke we saw in the trailer 3(!) times (the headbanging poodle).People did not laugh at all, not even the children! The conversations are horribly written, felt like they pulled out lines from the same kind of movies made in the last 20 years. Matter of fact the jokes that are also badly build up are also the same boring jokes that we saw before.The characters are weak, the motivations are simply stupid and the series of events is just a big idiotic cliché.I don't know what is the big hype around Kevin Hart lately, but he is bad as an actor and he proved himself to be bad as voice actor. Many times I did not understand what he screams, because all he does in every movie is shout in that very high pitch tone. You know what, I dare to say his character is based upon some racist stereotype cliché too, as no surprises he is the black gangsta type of character (at least act like one even though his character intended to be some sort of underground revolutionary leader, yet all they managed to come up with is a bad ""I am small and cool and crazy kind of gangsta).There are completely unnecessary scenes, just to squeeze out some sort of emotion from the audience and they sweat so they put some also cliché music behind it. Everything is so predictable and cheap in the plot and with the characters that is just amazing.There is one beautiful thing in the whole movie and it is the look of the water, matter of fact it is pretty, but what for? It is the same old Hollywood mistake repeated again, beautiful visuals and awful content.Would it be a disaster for once to spend more money and time on the plot and the character development and not just on the jaw dropping CGI.We all get used to off the good cgi. We know what is possible.Sometimes I have the feeling it is nothing else just some arty farty cgi show off with people who cannot grasp the possibilities of their own work.Do not waste 90 minutes from your life with this rubbish."
10,A friend in Need is a Friend Indeed,30 August 2016,"The Secret Life of Pets is an easy kid flick. It entertains without pressure. Limited animated violence, no sex, no foul language to speak of, and an easy-going plot make Secret Life an easy film to like.First and foremost, Secret Life is a buddy movie. Max and Duke are thrown together by circumstances, and neither one of them likes it. They try to sabotage each other with disastrous consequences.Lost in Brooklyn and separated from their friends, the two adversaries have to work together to get back home. In so doing, they become friends.As the cliché-proverb goes, a friend in need is a friend indeed.The film is kid-friendly, and only the youngest viewers might be upset. Unless your child is especially sensitive, I would recommend it for any kid over 5. I took my daughter, but then - she's 25, so she doesn't count as a kid I suppose.The only serious action is the death of a large snake. The snake is the author of his own demise though as he tries to eat our heroes. The episode is a clear turning point for Max and Duke.Animation decisions were excellent. Not too realistic, but not skimpy either. Secret Life is not a Miyazaki film, but then again Studio Ghibli is in a class of its own.Voice casting and acting was also excellent. Snowball was the only questionable acting job, and that was definitely not Kevin Hart's fault, but the fault of the writer or director who demanded rapid switching between a 'crazed' rabbit and 'leader' rabbit.Snowball is also the only character who made a sudden almost inexplicable decision to redeem himself after Max saves his life. The overall plot arch is fine, and a life-changing experience is a great tool to drive a character to switch his allegiance, but it's apparent that the artistic team was in a brain fog on the day they had to figure out how to get from Max saving Snowball to Snowball saving Max and Duke.About the rating: Folks, if you like a film, don't waste your vote. Give a 10. If it's mediocre, give it a 5. If it sucks, give it a 1.Secret Life does not deserve a 6.8. It's not a classic, and it's not a film that you will want to see again and again, but then it's not some dreadful propaganda flick, nor is it an awful chick flick, a foul-mouthed gore fest, nor a CGI sleep fest that requires two toothpicks to hold open your eyelids. If you're in the target audience, you probably will not want a refund of your money and your time.Secret Life delivered what was expected. Clean, family, kid-safe, safe-space fare for a few bucks.If Hollywood made more movies like Secret Life, they might not win awards at Sundance or Canne, but they might lure audiences back to the movies ..."
