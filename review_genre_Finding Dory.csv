7,"A Nice Sidetrack to the Original, if Occasionally Over-Similar",19 April 2017,"Back to the pond for Pixar, where we find things largely unchanged from the end of 2003's Finding Nemo. As the continually-forgetful blue tang Dory has a sudden enduring flash of her childhood, a rush of recall, she gathers the clownfish for one more globe-spanning adventure. The setup is a little soft, lingering too long in the shadow of the first film, but eventually we break free of that sentiment and forge a new (if similar) identity for the sequel. The closed-in landscape of an aquatic themed zoo/amusement park feels a bit claustrophobic at first glance, but as hijinx ensue and we learn more of Dory's early years, it all fleshes out nicely. No shortage of colorful new characters there, literally and figuratively, not the least of which is Ed O'Neill's escape artist ""septipus"" (having lost a tentacle in the touch tank), who treads dangerously close to becoming a deus ex machina with his versatility. O'Neill brings his usual disgruntled pessimism to the role, though, and some genuinely clever sight gags using the creature's natural assets go a long way to smoothing that over. He's overly convenient, but we're always glad to see him again. Witty and fast-paced, with a good mix of gags for the adults and their kids, plus a potent dose of the studio's famed poignancy. I laughed, I misted up, but I never quite fooled myself into thinking it was superior to the first."
8,Going away,12 June 2017,"This is a really good sequel. Taking characters from the first one and putting new ones in there as well, it never gets boring or seems to repetitive. And you don't even have to be Dory, I mean forgetful, for this to work for you. Yes it does make sense to watch the first one (Finding Nemo) then, although I reckon you could watch it and enjoy it as a standalone too.The characters and their traits are strong and there are a lot of side jokes built in to this too. Humans are being treated like extras and we wouldn't have the time to deal with them anyway. That is apart from one major voice - but it's being highlighted too as if one of the writers or Ellen herself might have a crush there. But you can't blame them for that. On the contrary you can congratulate everyone involved for a really good movie"
10,Simply a delightful movie,28 May 2017,"I have to admit that I was among many who rolled their eyes when a sequel to Finding Nemo was announced. I really didn't think there was anything else that could be done with that story. WRONG! It was honestly a million times better than I ever could have expected. I definitely loved it more than the original Finding Nemo. Dory was a fan favorite in the original film and the sequel delivers more of Ellen's whimsical portrayal of the forgetful little fish.I am a sucker for backstory (main reason I love the Star Wars prequels) and I absolutely loved the direction they took this film in. Fun for the whole family. Laughs, lessons, tons of heart. Who could ask for more? The voice acting cast was tremendous, particularly Ellen, of course. They really know how to pull you into this undersea world. I really wouldn't have changed anything about it. A truly delightful movie."
9,Excellent for kids,1 June 2017,"*May Contain Spoilers* This movie is about dory losing her parents when she was a little baby fish. Dory lost her parents due to suffering from short term memory loss. Now dory is older she begins to have flash backs of her parents and where she came from because she has never has known her real family. Some thoughts in her mind however make her realise she wants to find them. So dory decides to start on a sea adventure to try and find them with the help of her best friends marlin and Nemo the clown fish. Along the way dory has help from many other sea creatures in helping in trying to help find her parents. It is an exciting watching all the different situations that dory has to go through, whilst suffering from her short term memory loss, its funny yet sad and a little bit scary what happens to dory. Dory in the end actually remembers more than she actually knew. In the end dory finds here mum and dad because she remembered where she came from. This was a great adventure movie full of colourful sea creatures and a great ending for dory."
10,Awesome and sad,21 May 2017,"I thought that this movie would be boring since I got older and it's a kid's movie. I was very surprised and I found it better than finding Nemo. I could relate so much to Dory, I'm always forgetting things, I'm always lost and I cried so many times in this movie because I could relate. She is just like me and when other fishes got mad at her, I felt the same way she did. It was a very deep and emotional movie, I absolutely loved it (even though I don't remember everything). If you are constantly lost in your own world and have a fish memory, I guarantee that you will cry watching the movie."
1,Finding Dory Boring,17 July 2016,"What can I say? Maybe I'm just becoming a curmudgeon but I just don't find the fact that Dory lost her parents as a child and has been looking for them ever since very (read: at all) interesting. The movie opens with Dory as a small child, who features in several flashbacks thereafter. The cuteness factor of young Dory has been dialed up to 11 in a rather obvious attempt to invest the audience in Dory's plight that much more. But, to me, it just came off as saccharine.The movie wasn't very plausible either. Yes, I am fully aware this is a cartoon aimed at kids. But we're expected to believe Dory, having severe (and entirely plot-driven) memory loss somehow found her way as a small child from California all the way to Australia all by herself.Anyway, if I'd been able to find the basic plot interesting, I might have forgiven the movie's list of other other implausibilities and errors but, as it is, they just come off as irritating, and in service of a dull story. Some example:An octopus (actually, a ""septapus"", as it's missing a tentacle; more on that later) that can not only stay out of water indefinitely and disguise itself as anything, but can also learn to drive a car within seconds and drive it blind with only Dory to guide him.A fish tank in the kiddie section of an aquarium, where the kids are allowed to grab the creatures within the tank. This, incidentally, is where the octopus lost a tentacle because a kid pulled it off. And the aquarium was totally okay with this and let the kids go on grabbing fish. GTFOOH Pixar.The octopus finds himself back in the tank where kids can freely grab them. Conveniently, he forgets he can essentially become invisible, to force tension into the plotThe octopus steers a stroller past milling throngs of people, none of whom think it very remarkable.Whale sharks are not whales and do not eat fish. This is the most egregious, or at least most irritating, error committed by this film. Did Pixar not do research or did they just not care? Honestly, I find this error shocking coming from Pixar.Several fish-eating animals are seen throughout this movie that are only to happy to forget their dietary requirements: sea lions, loons, otters, it doesn't matter. The otters are even willing to risk their lives for this fish they don't know to help her do something about which they have no way of knowing anything. At least in the fIrst movie, there was some explanation given as to why pelicans and sharks would not eat fish. Here, it's just whatever serves the plot. It just feels lazy and cheap.I have a feeling echolocation doesn't work anything like it's portrayed here, but I won't make too much of it. But, wow, did that ""whale speak"" get REALLY annoying REALLY fast.I have usually considered Pixar to feature strong characters, but after THE GOOD DINOSAUR and this movie, I'm disappointed in how dull and/or annoying the characters are. Dory was fine as a supporting player (and in a better movie) but as the star, she's simply insufferable. Overall, I have always considered Pixar as synonymous with quality. But no longer. It will no longer be a given that a Pixar movie is going to be a winner."
1,Boring and disappointing,11 July 2016,Anticipated for this movie long time ago with high hope since I love Finding Nemo but this is such a huge disappointment. The 'short-term memory (remember-y here and there) lost' joke is getting old and at some point become annoying. Not until half way through the movie I got bored and wondered when the movie end. Couldn't laugh or at least chuckle at jokes thrown in the movie and the story seems to be put in a rush. Marlin and Nemo were also featured all the way in the movie and they were just fine. The dynamic between three of them were still there too however the adventures portrayed didn't really exciting and the thrill of the journey helping Dory on her quest finding her parents couldn't evoke emotions at all. I remembered myself laughed a lot watching Finding Nemo and at some point in tears too but not on this one. It's certainly not easy to be on par with a great movie with great visual effects and story line like Finding Nemo in the first place but at least this should have come close to it which sadly that is not the case. Definitely disappointed
8,Another hit from Pixar that uses CGI to assist in telling a story...,21 October 2016,"... rather than using a story to demonstrate dazzling CGI. This film was just as good as its predecessor, Finding Nemo. In this film (which takes place one year after 'Nemo'), Dory, who suffers from short term memory loss, makes it a mission to find her parents. She helped Marlon find Nemo in the first film and now she wants help locating her parents. She became separated from them when she was young and until now, has relied on others to help her find her way. She also gets by with her unique brand of impulsiveness and quick action. Throughout the film, Dory uses other ""people's"" (fishes'?) words and objects to trigger memories that assist her in finding her way. It was very clever how Pixar incorporated these triggers to help move the story along and flesh out Dory's background. I also liked how they treated short term memory loss with sensitivity and did not make it a joke. The marine center that Dory & co. end up at is based on the excellent Monterrey Bay Aquarium. The funniest new character added to the Nemo franchise is Hank the octopus (except he only has seven legs as Dory points out and refers to him as a ""septapus.""). Hank is cynical, but you know he's a softy deep inside. He can also camouflage himself into his settings which is quite comical. There are other funny characters like Becky the buzzard and Gerald the seal with a uni-brow.It seems that Pixar thrives on adding emotional scenes to their films that pull at their audience's heartstrings. Finding Dory is no exception. There is a very dramatic scene near the end of the film where Dory is separated from her party and is lost in an unfamiliar, dark ocean, alone. She has to rely on herself to figure out how to find her way out and find her friends. This was a very heart wrenching scene. I won't lie, it made me tear up and I could hear other people sniffling in the theater. Another emotional scene is the beginning of the film showing a baby Dory with her parents. It's not as sad though as the beginning of Up, though.I'd recommend this one."
4,"A big, hectic chunk of cinematic nonsense",23 August 2016,"Finding Dory wins just one miserable star, for one reason: The animation throughout is astonishingly realistic.However, almost everything else about the film is a train wreck of ocean-sized proportions. Take no notice of the reviews of the critics, who seem to be doing everything to try and defend this horribly misguided mess.But how is it a mess? Here's why. The whole film just fails to give you a reason to want to sit through all of it again. It doesn't feel like a proper story, instead more like a series of antics and ideas thrown into an overflowing, ugly mix. It's chaotic, too long and so stupid at times that it has to be seen to be believed. This is easily one of Pixar's worst.Finding Dory's most egregious flaw as its shockingly incompetent pacing. The film is frantic, mindless and over-concerned with shoving in jokes and sight gags. Scenes are so rushed and so needlessly silly that they just aren't believable. Introduced characters get little development and are just forgettable. Will anyone really remember or care about Hank the octopus, Destiny the whale shark or those argumentative sea-lions in the future?The film's strict adherence to sequel clichés also seriously crosses the line. Returning plot elements, rehashed scenarios, character cameos and overblown action scenes are all here and are never justified. In fact, by the end of it, the entire film hasn't even justified its existence. Furthermore, the characters suffer so much bad luck that it eventually turns into ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" with fish. Everything starts going wrong. Detours are constantly taken. Death is cheated over and over. And yet, the characters constantly escape via methods so contrived and convenient that it's impossible to take seriously. Admittedly, it's kind of creative in places, but it's also as predictable as you can imagine.The climax, however, is where the film finally crashes into the ground. It's astoundingly awful. Picture this - an octopus driving a lorry extremely poorly and not crashing into any oncoming cars. A large group of otters hugging each other in the middle of the road in order to stop these cars. And finally, the same lorry being driven over a hill and into the sea. This is the climax simplified - except that it's way, way worse than that. It can't even describe how bad it is. It's a horribly written climax and is jaw-droppingly nonsensical.Why stop there? The film fails in so many other ways that you can play bingo with its flaws. There are way too many flashbacks to Dory's cutesy childhood. ""Emotional"" scenes are dull and stretched thin. Marlin and Nemo are in it, but mean little to the plot. A scene where a bunch of kids are touching some sea life, who are shown feeling the constant pain, is not at all funny but uncomfortable. Several scenes, like one with a talking clam, just feel shoved in for no reason. Many jokes fall flat. The dialogue is stale and charmless. I could go on and on.The whole thing is an embarrassing atrocity. As much as I'd love to give more stars to this movie, I feel it deserves just one. Because the bad aspects of this movie are so bad, they essentially undo the good ones. Yes, it's well-animated. Yes, it has some very minor charming parts. Yes, it can be creative at times. But everything else about the film is brainless to a damning extreme. Finding Nemo worked because it was melancholic, tear-jerking and uplifting. It resonated with everyone. Its sequel has almost none of what made the original a masterpiece."
2,Disappointed,21 June 2016,"I watched this movie with very high hopes. I was a kid when Finding Nemo came out and it defined kids movies at the time. Finding Dory was significantly less impressive. The good: The move was very cute and the characters were fun. Ed O'Neill as a cranky octopus was especially nice. The bad: The whole movie feels as if Pixar was pressed to come out with a solid movie and just threw this one together really fast. It felt very rushed and therefore the story line, which had a little potential, was hard to really get into and appreciate. 3/4 of the way through, though it felt rushed, the movie became very redundant and predictable. I was pretty over it personally and could have stopped the movie then and been a happy camper. One of Pixar's lazier films and it's disappointing considering the astounding work they have done before it. If you want to enjoy a movie like this, just watch Finding Nemo instead. If you want to see the sequel to they aforementioned and terrific film, your imagination of how the movie should play out is probably better than the real thing."
3,Meh,17 June 2016,"Okay - Blackfish apparently caused a rewrite of the movies ending, presumably the species of the character Destiny. Okay... Pretty sure the writers had enough time to do some research and figure out that a whale-shark is not in fact a whale, and doesn't eat fish... Why not just feed the fish into the beluga's tank? Why not have the beluga 'speak whale' instead? We get it, it's a cartoon - but willful suspension of disbelief is lost when my 3 year old is calling out this sort of stuff (granted, he's been fortunate enough to go to the aquarium in Atlanta) There is no magic in Dory - in fact, it's greatest problem may be that there's too much Dory. In the first she acted as a great foil to Marlin - here... well... There's no foil for Dory.Watch it again - as stated earlier, got a three year old so it might happen. Pay to watch it again? No. Do it by choice? No. Allow my kid to watch it again? Sure, there's worse, but then again, there's better too: frankly, ""A Turtle's Tale 2"" was better, with a fresher recycled soundtrack even with a remarkably similar plot line.Currently Rotten Tomatoes is giving it a 'certified fresh' rating - I'm left wondering if there is an octopus writing their critical reviews."
3,"""Finding Dory""-boring, commercial, crass and totally unbelievable.",26 June 2016,"Movies today are very commercial, we all know this. I've been going to animated type films with my granddaughter for many years and God bless, she always says she loves them all.And so she did with Finding Dory but I was disgusted the entire movie.First, we did see it in 3D, something I seldom do because I don't see the benefit of the extra money. But in the case of THIS movie, it is the one good thing I could say about it. This movie, under the sea, the marine life, the beautiful color, was gorgeous in 3D.Now let's discuss the very, very stupid plot of this movie.We begin by asserting that we do understand that giving animals human like traits is very common and I don't have a problem with this. It's part of the joy of watching, adds to the understanding, gives a depth to the plot.But come on people, a fish with a short term memory problem? That's a rare thing even in humans for goodness sake, much less a fish with a brain smaller than a pea.It's just too much to buy into is my complaint, that a fish manages to go through life forgetting everything is just learned because of this brain anomaly.And the plot is very far-fetched, with fish hijacking trucks and flying with birds and translating fish water echoes into visual sights.Seems Dory, the star of the movie and one of the fish who saved Elmo, an animate film from many years ago that was much more believable, lost her parents and the story is about Dory's determination to find them.And Dory, come on, she's the only fish in the movie with buck teeth and why is this? Because Ellen DeGeneres, the voice of Dory, has teeth exactly like the cartoon fish and this was just so obvious. I like Ellen DeGeneres and consider she was a perfect voice for Dory, but DeGeneres has never met a promotional opportunity that she'd let pass by. Including having a fish with her voice look like her.The story has a bunch of fish helping Dory find her parents and we've got seashell trails and forgetful Dory and a silly plot that looked as if a bunch of people threw a bunch of idea confetti on the table and an absurd story was somehow concocted.Of course we have Dory stuff at McDonald's and Pixar, AKA Disney, will make money on this fluff thrown together with little care save for the merchandise and revenue.Come on producers and directors out there! You got to have a little pride when crafting an animated movie. The color and 3D of ""Finding Dory"" ain't going to cut it.This movie is best for someone five years old or less, someone who won't laugh at the silly concept of a forgetful fish."
2,Not anywhere nearly as good as Finding Nemo!,17 June 2016,"I was super disappointed in this film, given that it was rated 4.5 stars. It had way too much of Dory. I wish I had a nickel for every time she mentioned she has memory problems; I'd be stinking rich. Trust me, the bad memory shtick gets very old after a short time.If you love Dory, yes you will like the movie. But if Dory all the time is a bit much for you, you will get bored by this fast. The new whale characters just were not very interesting either. The 2 grand-kids liked Finding Dory OK, but I doubt if they would want to see it again. This is not the first time I've been disappointed in a highly-rated kids film, 5 stars just doesn't mean the quality it did in the past."
1,The worst of Pixar,18 June 2016,"For a studio that has a brilliant track record, with incredible movies like Wall-e, Finding Nemo, Toy Story, Cars, and others, Finding Dory is a complete embarrassment. It is, in fact, too bad to be considered with its prequel. There were a few scenes that did touch the heart, but overall it was more of a joke. The original film brought several new ideas that all of us liked, this one doesn't bring anything substantially new. The same Dory which was cute in the first part is too annoying in this one. Sometimes, she is just unbearable. The dialogues are mostly boring. I rarely feel like sleeping while watching a movie, this one did make me fall asleep two times very briefly. I loved the first part and I was so excited with this one too. As the movie started, I tried to make myself believe that it is not bad, but by the interval time, I felt like leaving before finishing it! I will always agree that some scenes were really good, but they were acutely insufficient to save this movie. For me, a movie that had Pixar with its name was automatically considered as a must-watch, but now, you've destroyed your name Pixar."
1,"Adoptive / Foster parents be warned, this is not for every child!",23 June 2016,"I am still a kid at heart and never miss out on a Disney or Pixar film, ever. But this one establishes two problems for children who have been adopted or are in foster care. First - Dory is, as we all know, forgetful, and that is why she was separated from her parents, thus - it is HER FAULT. Second - Dory has loving, friendly parents who are emotionally and mentally stable and have been actively looking for her for years, therefor perpetuating most adopted / fostered children's fantasies regarding their birth parents, but is most often NOT the case. This is grossly unfair to any child not anticipating this theme in the film, did Pixar forget how literal children are? So be thoughtful and take the time to see this insensitive film before taking your children. Even birth children need to have a talk with their parents about NOT making adoptive friends / classmates feel that this could be the outcome if they are adopted. Our adopted daughter years for a relationship with her birth mother, and we are actively looking for her and praying for a good end result. Many times birth parents want nothing to do with their birth children. Again, Pixar really dropped the ball on this one, for all the screaming this industry does to be sensitive to most groups of people, I guess they didn't bother to give a second thought to this particular group."
1,Boring,2 July 2016,"This had to be one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. Both my wife and I fell asleep. There was almost no humor. It was just a ridiculous ""adventure"" (if you could call it that), and it seemed to go on and on. If you are going to make an animated movie, there should be some humor in it for the adults. After all, adults are the ones PAYING for the movie.My nap was the best part of the movie. While I was awake, I had to suffer though the annoying voice of Ellen DeGeneres. The Dory character was okay in the first movie as a secondary character, but they should have never made a movie around this obnoxious character.The only good think I can say is that my 6 year old thought it was okay."
1,Boring,14 September 2016,"I did not enjoy this film at all. First of all, the title makes no sense. Dory is looking for her parents, whilst Marlin and Nemo are just chasing after her. That part is not interesting. The new characters seemed like generic movie side characters and didn't impress me. It does seem like Dory was faking her short term memory loss. The fact she was looking for her family and then first met Marlin, does not work for me. I do not recommend this film as it was disappointing and wasn't as entertaining and appealing as Finding Nemo was. I wouldn't watch it again and once again do not recommend this disappointing film. This is all just my opinion."
4,Doesn't Compare To Finding Nemo,3 July 2016,"Sometimes there are films that are untouchable and I think something like Finding Nemo was one of them. Whilst Dory was a beloved character in the film, I believe it was a stretch having her become the star of her own film in Finding Dory.The other problem with creating spin-off films (or sequels and remakes for that matter), is that you find yourself consistently comparing them to the original. This can be detrimental if the original was close to perfection. I found that the things I loved about Finding Nemo were missing from Finding Dory. One of the great things about the first movie was that the adventure was never-ending. We started with the loss of Nemo and we followed his father Marlon and his sidekick Dory on a quest to find him. Along the way, we met various characters and encountered differing scenarios that kept us on our toes. The gnarly surfer dude sea turtles, the immense field of jellyfish, the creepy creature that lured the two protagonists with a distracting shiny light dangling from the tip of his head and the group of wannabe vegetarian sharks (lead by the intimidating but friendly Bruce). Not to mention what Nemo was going through and the friends and foes he was encountering at a dental surgery in Sydney.Finding Dory didn't really have any of that. Whilst Dory did meet a few quirky friends along the way, I felt like the flow of the film was missing. Either the interactions were brief (like when she met a couple of fish who were trying to help Dory but couldn't figure her out because of her condition), or they were long and laboured (like when she met Hank the octopus and subsequently Bailey and Destiny at the Marine Life Institute). For me, it seemed like Dory was quick to move from point A to point B (from Australia to the United States) but then lingered on point B for a very long time.Visually, as was expected, the film was faultless and despite all of the above, there were still some delightful moments that made you laugh and made you cry. Unfortunately, it wasn't enough to keep me interested and instead of wanting Dory to find herself, I found myself looking at my watch and waiting for the end credits to begin rolling.motherofpopcorn.wordpress.com"
4,Utter disappointment,12 July 2016,"I don't care whether critics say it is nice or not. It may look great visually, but truth be told, there isn't much more to it than that. The lines get too repetitive, too redundant. The plot is too thin, and the characters pretty annoying. The forgetfulness that was cute in finding Nemo got to a point where it is plainly dumb and irritating here. The trick gets old, it loses its value. It is just like ""minions"". The small yellow guys were cute in despicable me, but they should not have gotten their own movies. Same here. Dory is uninteresting, and while some scenes make people feel with her, i spent most of the movie wondering when it was going to end. It is one of Pixar's worst movies."
4,below average movie,25 June 2016,"i used to be a be pixar fan, and loved classic films like Nemo and Monster. However, since Steve Jobs sold Pixar to Disney, the creativity and imagination have died with the trade. Dory is no exception, feels like a recycled Nemo but with much worse plot, worse cgi, worse pretty much everything. It is pretty hard to believe, 15 years since the original Nemo, the quality of the animation actually has become worse.The only bright spot of the movie, was the 5 minute mini movie Piper. I should pixar makes a feature length movie for that.Wall-E was the last good pixar films. all junks after that. I wish jobs has never sold pixar to Disney.I wonder what junk will pixar dish out next year... sigh..."
5,'Finding Disappointment',20 June 2016,"Like the rest of the world I waited a long thirteen years before the next chapter of the Finding Nemo saga arrived. What could go wrong? The absolute truth of it is that none of it was worth it. I know that sounds very negative but honestly, I was expecting a 'Toy Story 3' like follow up, excellence! To be fair you can never really get your hopes up too high, or else you'll always be disappointed, but even with steady expectations, the film fails. Midway through the movie I was shocked at how much I was disliking it, the original Finding Nemo is still one of Pixar's all time greats! There's a saying about sequels and how they're never as good as the original, but Finding Dory doesn't even come close, and doesn't even feel like a necessary addition to the story. It also doesn't feel much like a Pixar movie, strangely enough. First of all the all-age-groups humour is gone here and just appeals to little kids, even thought it's PIXAR! Dory's memory loss issue gets repetitive, not to mention that the film doesn't even bring you to tears at any point, not even close to them. The supporting characters here are very weak compared to the awesome Tank Gang from the original, who aren't even in this one! The only redeeming side- character is Hank the Septopous, who is pretty interesting and funny at times. I may have been a bit black and white about the whole humour aspect, the movie can be extremely funny when it wants to be, but most of the time just appealing to the younger demographic. Another thing I have to give the film major credit for is the animation, WOW, Pixar have really outdone themselves here! The overall story is a bit weak too, and the fact that the whole film takes place in the same place (A Sea Resort) gets kinda boring and even dull at times. The whole movie is in a way inexplicably bad, and just feels sort of off after you leave the cinema. It's such a bitter note, once again proving how badly a sequel can ruin the greatness of an original! As my title suggests there is nothing to be found here except some cheap jokes and decent animation. An unworthy entry for Pixar and an absolute disgrace when compared to the amazing original. I really do not recommend you see this, unless you want your love for Finding Nemo to be banished. I really was hoping for something good, I was so excited walking in and so depressed walking out. Finding Disappointment... I was..."
1,Finding entertainment,15 August 2016,"Sorry but this just didn't work.. the story line was tired to say the least. Whilst there were a few subtle pastiches to keep parents interested there weren't enough. and even my four year old got down from their seat and came over to ask me ""Is it finishing soon ? I'm bored."" My nine year old managed to keep awake throughout which is his usual way of showing his view on a film so maybe it's not all bad. But with the current cost of Cinema (movie house) tickets (£30 $40) in London I did feel somewhat disappointed. This was a Disney Pixar production was we had our anticipation set by their previous material, but this was a low point on their output. From Finding Nemo a sequel was obviously going to make an appearance. This admittedly didn't give the writers much scope for a story. But they needed to have included more comical asides within the main story and increased the pace of the second quarter."
5,Why Pixar??,17 June 2016,"Well it's been thirteen years but we finally have the movie that no one asked for, 'Finding Dory'. Following the huge success of 'Finding Nemo' it's hard to imagine that this film wasn't going to happen. Even if we all got down and begged Pixar not to, they still probably would have made this movie. So this time around, Dory is our main character. Yes, Pixar has completely made up a story to give to the side character that everyone loved so much. With in the first ten minutes Dory magically remembers that she has a family and goes on the hunt for them. Sound like the first the film? Well it is.It's exactly like the first one. Only the difference is that this one is really stupid. 'Finding Nemo' happened because Nemo was taken away from his father. Him and his father were the only survivors after some fished killed their whole family. So it made sense that Nemos dad would trek across the whole ocean to find him. The problem here is that you don't really care about what is going on at all. The story the film builds around it's characters is absolute nonsense. You mean to tell me that in the entire year that Dory was living with these guys no one bothered to ask her about her family? And that all those phrases that triggered her memory she was hearing for the first time in her life?I don't think so Pixar. As I watched this film it was apparent that this film was farted into existence. The film makers clearly just used this characters handicap to make up a pointless story. I mean they seriously could not think of any better way to tell the story then to just have her flash back like one hundred times?Not only is this incredibly lazy but it made the whole movie feel incredibly convenient. The films story is only taking place because of something that was completely random and ridiculous. Not only that, but they seriously could not have come up with anything better than just rehashing the same story? It's exactly the same story as the first just, the characters are playing slightly different roles.How on earth do the film makers think that one can be invested in this film if the first one was not only the same, but better? The first had real, relatable emotions and experiences going on. It was easy to connect with the characters and sympathize with their voyage. But this film doesn't do any of that. It just expects you to be blinded by nostalgia and love everything that is happening simply because you remember those characters.Which it does nothing new with either. There was really only one new character in the whole film that had any kind of personality. Aside from that every new thing we are introduced to is only just as a plot device. Other than that, their main purpose was to be comedy relief. Which was mainly pointed at making fun of other handicapped animals. If this film isn't subtly telling your children that you should make fun of handicapped people I don't know what is.While I certainly did not enjoy this film it isn't without its few saving graces. For starters, the voice acting is once again great. Ellen as Dory is closest thing to perfect casting I have seen. Her and the other actors involved really seemed to commit to their performances. And while the story as a whole isn't good there are a couple of great scenes in there. The scene in the kid zone is particular great. Seeing how these fish view these kids poking them and grabbing them is pretty ingenious. As a whole it is also very well paced. There was very few dull moments here. That being said, this film should not have happened. Not only is it a symbol of how far Pixar has fallen but how much they actually care about their audience. No longer do they desire to make quality pictures, no, it's all about the money now. This is very apparent thanks to how little thought was put into this movie. If you have kids, they might enjoy it. But if not, this one really is not worth your time."
4,Awful!,23 July 2016,"I love Finding Nemo so for me, this movie was a disappointment. The plot was weak and it seemed like they couldn't think of a proper way to end it. The graphics wasn't as good as last time and Dory seemed to have lost her charm. They played on her forgetting to bring forced humour. In Finding Nemo the characters were all lovable and unique but in this one they were all similar and uninteresting. After all the buildup of Dory trying to find her family, when she finally did it wasn't powerful enough. I had to roll my eyes when Dory was driving the truck with the octopus because it was so cliché. The only scenes that were good were Dory's memories of when she was a baby, she was adorable! Overall, a good movie but nowhere near Pixars' normal standards."
1,High expectations to low expectations,4 August 2016,Anticipated for this movie long time ago with high hope since I love Finding Nemo but this is such a huge disappointment. The 'short-term memory (remember-y here and there) lost' joke is getting old and at some point become annoying. Not until half way through the movie I got bored and wondered when the movie end. Couldn't laugh or at least chuckle at jokes thrown in the movie and the story seems to be put in a rush. Marlin and Nemo were also featured all the way in the movie and they were just fine. The dynamic between three of them were still there too however the adventures portrayed didn't really exciting and the thrill of the journey helping Dory on her quest finding her parents couldn't evoke emotions at all. I remembered myself laughed a lot watching Finding Nemo and at some point in tears too but not on this one. It's certainly not easy to be on par with a great movie with great visual effects and story line like Finding Nemo in the first place but at least this should have come close to it which sadly that is not the case. Definitely disappointed
5,I had high hopes,23 June 2016,"As someone who adores Finding Nemo and has waited YEARS for a sequel, I must say I am disappointed. Finding Dory definitely has a sequel feel to it. This didn't feel like a story that is worth a thirteen year wait. There are certainly cute and funny moments, but nothing solid enough to become a favorite. I've seen Finding Nemo so many times, but Dory is one I'll probably never watch again unless it's with my nephew or something. I didn't feel like this was a Pixar movie for all ages; it seemed more appropriate for younger audiences (I'm 24). As much as I hate admitting it, I couldn't wait for it to be over. Near the last quarter or so of the movie it just got redundant and all I could think was, ""Ok, this can be over any time now."" I enjoyed seeing characters from Nemo make appearances, and a couple new characters were charming, but overall it's not enough to make Dory an instant classic like Nemo. Pixar outdid themselves with the animation but you can tell this is a sequel for the sake of a sequel, not because they came up with a great storyline."
4,Can't match up to Finding Nemo,20 July 2016,"I have always liked watching children's film, animated or live- action since most of the time they are fun or well-written or both. I have no problems suspending disbelief when it comes to movies since I know that cinema is a different art form and it can be just pure entertainment and escapist fun (that has to use some unbelievable action sequences or scenes). A good film, for me, does not need to please the critics all the time or be too realistic and philosophical. I can enjoy almost all movies as long they are not pretentious and just want to tell a good story, whether in a profound way or in an entertaining way.However, I had to suspend my disbelief too many times while watching Finding Dory and the story is not compelling enough for me. I also find Dory so annoying here though I liked the octopus very much.Maybe I expected too much since I enjoyed Finding Nemo even though I also had to suspend my disbelief when watching it, but the suspension of disbelief did not make me question the plot too much. I also thought that Finding Dory would be a good sequel since I enjoyed the sequels of famous animated films like Toy Story 2, Ice Age 2, Kung Fu Panda 2. Well I thought wrong!!!!"
4,It was sad movie not Happy,25 June 2016,"Finding Nemo was a movie I dare to say worth watching more than once and I was so exited to see Finding Dory. But as we were watching it the sound of my 7 years old daughter crying confirmed my thoughts . It is not a happy Disney / Pixar movie and not suitable for many kids. My baby girl even through away her Finding Dory toy ! She said :"" why would I want it when I even don't like the movie ? "" She was so sad and scared of loosing us. Though the characters were cute specially Ed O'Neill did an amazing job with his character ""Hank"" but unfortunately the story line was rush and unorganized . Such sad scenes for a baby Dory was not a wise choice ."
1,I thought it was kay,6 July 2016,honest it has Medicare but still enjoyably i liked baby dory she was soupier cute but the plot was literal garbage and my child cried when they found dory it was so sad i mean pix er makes movies that are mindless and children can enjoy them and parents hate them so why should this movie bee any different. I liked it and id never see it again if i was forced to like seriously why is Tom henks playing an octopus hes like such &#865; horrible actor jk i love you henks ;) anyway i think that Disney really should just stop making movies because all of then suck like actually though why? They literally make me want to throw up &#865; donut. Although i did like Finding Dory. That was a stellar movie 200000/10 give it a Grammy!!!!!!!!!!!!! ;) :D XD ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
5,Bumbler Survives To A Happy Ending.,2 July 2016,"Adventure in Fantasyland sums this up. It's cute, it's cuddly, it's silly. It's a cartoon. It's Disney.So, stay on the surface if you want to enjoy this movie but don't dive deeper into it b/c it's unpleasant.Every movie has a villain/difficulty for the protagonist to overcome. Dory's short term memory loss is the ""villain"". It separates her from her loving parents and plagues her throughout the movie with a gnawing sense that she's not where she's suppose to be. It causes her to trust strangers, some who are natural predators - one who does not have her best interest but eventually gives into her plight. The message: Even predators will help you if your persistently cute and innocent. Not a good message in reality.Her memory loss leads her into dangerous situations as she is physically lost. But the main, clear message is ""Just bumble along in life, you won't get hurt, and everyone is there to help you. Life is a happy adventure."" The reality is she would have been victimized or killed each step of the way. Inaccuracies abound. Salt water fish surviving in fresh water. Sea Urchins in a touch and play tank - ouch. Shark whale called a whale. A fish has the capability to read English but can't remember moment to moment - that's just stupid. More and more movies are coming out that are too much like video games. Action without consequences. Story lines abandoning reality - even physics and the natural laws - promoting moralities based upon dangerous falsehoods. First thing you learn in middle school English is ""What is the moral of the story?"" What IS the moral of this story? It's not just wrong, it's dangerous.So, if you really want to enjoy this movie just be like Dory! Just bumble along for the ride and don't think much. La-la-la. Weeeee."
3,Dull and unnecessary repetition of original,15 August 2016,"I'll come out and admit up front that ""Finding Nemo"" is not one of my favourite Pixar movies. When it was released I found it quite easily the least funny Pixar movie to date and, having followed ""Monsters Inc."", I worried that Pixar were shifting their focus to the kids in the audience without delivering so many of the clever references and gags that are the core of their appeal to adults. Happily ""The Incredibles"" followed the subsequent year, still the best movie the studio has produced.Critical reception for ""Finding Dory"" convinced me to give it a go, but I wish I had listened to my instincts to avoid this one. Much like its predecessor, the film is generally lacking in humour and barely raised a chuckle from me throughout. Not much thought seems to have gone into making clever gags, exemplified by the oft-mentioned use of Sigourney Weaver as voice talent. It's like someone at Pixar said ""Hey, wasn't it funny when we had Sigourney Weaver as the voice of the ship's computer in ""WALL-E""? Well, yes, it was - because that was a clever reference to the film ""Alien"". Here, no such reference exists, so it's just unfunny name-dropping.The lack of humour compounds upon a really weak story line that is soul-drainingly repetitive. It is no spoiler to say that the vast majority of this movie consists of the three main characters being split up on their way somewhere, managing to get back together again and then immediately being split up again. It happened over and over again until I was internally screaming at the film to come to a merciful end. The film's emotional core is a simple rehash of the original and never rises above the bargain-basement ""Family is good"" and ""You can do it if you try"" tropes of a million other kids films. It's a far cry from the subtlety exhibited by last year's ""Inside Out"".Possibly most damning of all is the fact that this movie doesn't even push the visual boundaries of the original. Considering that it's been 13 years I was expecting to be wowed by some great underwater visuals, but this film doesn't look any better than its predecessor. Disappointing to say the least.Overall this is definitely one to skip unless its to keep young children occupied for 90 minutes. Given that next year we have an unwanted 3rd ""Cars"" movie, we'll have to hope that original IP ""Coco"" can demonstrate the qualities that we've come to expect from Pixar - they're in short supply here."
4,Finind a reason for Finding Dory,1 August 2016,"Took my two children ages 5 and 9 to watch. The opening Pixar Piper was awesome!They can really convey a story with no dialog and be totally entertaining. However, Dory with all the dialog just fell flat. I think many would agree that there are many movies that don't need a sequel, no matter how much money they made with the first.Some movies, like Nemo, already complete an original story and tie up the ends nicely. Pixar really hit the underwater CGI at 100% with Nemo. I believe that, combined with lovable characters, good main plot, and very cleaver idea interactions (sharks, crabs, gulls, dentist office and aquarium scenes, all the mini-struggles along the way, and the development of the character arcs like Marlin/Nemo, Marlin/Dory, etc) made Nemo an innovative cartoon movie for all ages, hence the immense success. Sure, writers can contrive any number of plot lines into a sequel, but form without substance renders a somewhat lackluster sequel=Dory. The movie is highly colorful and continues Pixars excellent water CGI but can't top what was already done to perfection in Nemo. The story re-acquaints the old characters with some as-expected new characters, with a brief turtle Crush cameo. The sea lions were cute, the octopus made for a few laughs, but the whole ""I can't remember.."" Dory character was so overused that it overshadowed the movie with a somber melodrama. I could hear many kids groaning in the theater as the movie dragged on, my two barely stayed awake. The Dory character in Nemo had a purpose, was used skillfully and moved the movie along with some slapstick lines by DeGeneres almost like Robin Williams' Aladdin. But to make that a core plot and centerpiece is not enough to carry a movie. I guess it makes sense to Hollywood to take a move like Nemo, that cost $94mil and grossed probably a billion with marketing and toys, is enough reason to stretch for a sequel. Did it work for Kung Fu Panda, Ice Age, Chipmunks, Happy Feet, Shrek, Toy Story, Despicable Me, Madagascar, How to Train Dragon? Admittedly sometimes yes, but not this time."
4,"Finding Dory is supposed to be a worthy sequel, but it isn't.",9 July 2016,"I am a very big Pixar fan. I grew up watching all the Pixar classics when I was a kid. Toy Story, The Incredibles, Wall-E, and Finding Nemo are some examples of my favorite Pixar movies of all time. When the Finding Dory teaser played before The Force Awakens, that effing piano at the beginning gave me goosebumps. The highly anticipated sequel to our favorite classic is here! I was very excited as I entered the theater. I wasn't surprised that 40% of the theater was occupied by children (although the most surprising thing here is that elders were dominant). It was supposed to be a great day to spend Father's Day last month. But as I exit the theater, I don't know exactly what was wrong with me. I felt kind of underwhelmed and disappointed at the same time. Is this the most disappointing Pixar film yet?First, I'll list the only good stuff in the movie.1. Voice acting. The old cast in this sequel still have the same energy they had back in 2003. The new cast such as Idris Elba, Diane Lane, Eugene Levy, and Ed O'Neill shined in their roles. 2. Humor. Although the humor is aimed at kids, there were also jokes made to fly over their heads. Sigourney Weaver's scene and Dory considering her as her friend as an example. It's a remarkable scene.Now here are all the flaws in the film:1. Story. Not only did I notice the storyline is rushed, but even others did. Are they low on budget? I don't know.2. Plot. This is a problem most people have with the film. The plot is basically a rehash of the first Finding Nemo! I didn't have any expectation of wishing for something original since this is the first time Pixar rehashed a classic. Add some exaggerating and unbelievable moments in the film.3. Lack of heart. Another big problem with the film is that it lacked heart. When I heard that there are no teary eyed moments, my excitement lowered a bit. However, when my friends said they did cry, I went to the theater also expecting to cry. But there wasn't any time for teary eyed moments. Take Inside Out, Toy Story 3, Up, and Finding Nemo as examples. They broke our hearts so much that you can't resist crying. The story is ""so human"". In Finding Dory, they were replaced with laughs instead. 4. The Tank Gang's appearance. Why were they at the after end credits scene? They could've been in the actual movie instead of letting only a small amount of people getting to see them again. Really disappointing.5. Exaggerating moments. The new character named Hank was a really likable character, until he was ruined in the third act. He actually drives a truck on the road! Would you also like to see fishes hijack a truck? What about a whale shark escaping from its tank? You'll find those here. What a move, Pixar.6. Music. Thomas Newman is a great movie composer. But he's not so great here. His music sounds so uninspired and he didn't bring the original Finding Nemo theme (excluding one scene). Dory's theme is too similar to the theme of Finding Nemo. And at times, his music gave me a Dreamworks feel.7. Theme song. I literally hated Unforgettable. It sounds more of a James Bond theme (kinda sounds like Writing's on the Wall from SPECTRE) than a Finding Dory theme song. Sia wasn't even a good choice to sing the theme song. Is Hollywood hiring famous singers to sing theme songs for every single movie? The terrible Ghostbusters remake has Fall Out Boy performing the theme. Bad idea. What's next? Justin Bieber singing a new theme for Rogue One?8. Children are treated like devils. This isn't really an issue in Toy Story 3, but they did it again here. It's like saying Pixar thinks children are devils.As you can see, I am very disappointed with Finding Dory. I was ready to give this a 10, but after seeing the movie, I am very disappointed. This is supposed to be a worthy sequel, but it isn't. Instead, we were given another mediocre sequel from Pixar (in my ratings Cars 2 is rated higher than this because at least the characters are not exaggerating and we had a really good theme, but it's still a disappointing Pixar movie). It's not as good as Finding Nemo either. This won't be in my Pixar collection. This is the second Pixar movie not to be present there. I refuse to believe this exists. Hopefully The Incredibles 2 won't be as mediocre as this.4/10."
5,A bland sequel - as to be expected by Pixar as of late,20 June 2016,"Pixar has not had the best track record as of late releasing mediocre films such as ""The Good Dinosaur"", ""Brave"" and lifeless sequels such as ""Monsters University"" and to an extent ""Toy Story 3"", so going into this one I did not have high expectations. While somewhat more enjoyable than the previous films mentioned, ""Finding Dory"" just does not have much going for it, which is to be expected considering how unnecessary this sequel is. Finding Nemo was a great film on its own and it seems that Pixar is cashing in this time by attempting to ""expand"" the side character of Dory, and the result was not great.In the first 10-20 mins Dory is excruciatingly annoying, having all the conversations revolve around her, the short-term memory condition gets painful really fast, especially in the attempt to make brainless, lazy ""jokes"". This just goes to show that Dory's character was never intended to be front and center, but rather as comic relief, and similar to ""Cars 2"" with Mater, while it works in the first one it is simply tiring in the sequel. Pixar knew this well, and tried to fix it by having the movie spend wasted time with Marlin and Nemo with little attempt to expand their characters.Although, rather than expanding Dory's character, they just rehash her arc from the first one, and instead give her an uninspired backstory relying purely on Dory being ""cute"". What ensues is another typical, generic Pixar ""adventure"", plagued with unnecessary flashbacks that only serve to interrupt the flow of the movie.I will say however that the most enjoyable part of the film were the various humorous parts of the movies such as the Seals and also Octopus, a character that endured more growth throughout the movie than the lead. On the other hand, there were also the film's fair share of brainless jokes, such as the Sigourney Weaver announcement that was repeated so many times that it had a numbing effect, alongside the rehashed jokes from the first one including the whale calling and ""just keep swimming"" song that only remind the audience just how far Pixar have fallen.Overall, ""Finding Dory"" is by no means awful, it is however an extremely mediocre, average and forgettable film, adding yet another blemish on what used to be Pixar's quality track record. The future for the studio is not looking bright with 3 out of the 4 movies in production being more sequels, but let's hope that they have the capacity to try something different or at least slightly straying from the norm."
4,Non-Stop Panic Attacks & Some Comedy Relief,13 July 2016,"Attention: This review is about the premise of the story and the reoccurring themes throughout the entire movie.A huge portion of this movie is Dory freaking out about memory loss. She is constantly going to a dark place, as she realizes over and over and over again, that she is in a perpetual nightmare of forgetting what she's doing and worrying about forgetting who her friends and family are.If you want to watch a mentally-ill fish continuously losing her sh**, beating up on herself for feeling inadequate, and flopping into a downward spiral of sadness, then this is the movie for you.Luckily, for the rest of us, there is comedy sprinkled throughout. But only just enough to feel like short breaks from the usual punishment of ""I keep forgetting, What is wrong with me, I keep forgetting, What was I doing, I keep forgetting, I am all alone, I keep forgetting, I need to remember what I was doing"", etc."
2,"Very Boring, not as good at the first!",2 September 2016,"This is probably the worst Pixar movie. My girlfriend and I fell asleep. The initial idea was good. But it wasn't funny at all! The ending was stupid.We didn't see it 3D, but even so, still could not have gave it more than 3 stars.I hope they wont't make it ""Finding Marlin"" or something since this was a huge disappointment after such a long time.I see here that many people are saying that this was better than Finding Nemo! Trust me, save your money for something else."
4,Good if you never saw Finding Nemo and have no expectations- bad otherwise,18 July 2016,"Is was an okay animated film but if know anything about Finding Nemo, not so good. Dory's infamous memory issues disappear in this film besides her occasionally saying that she has memory problems. Nemo and Marly basically disappear. I like the addition of the new cast and live the Modern Family addition. I love the new characters just was a horrible addition to Finding Nemo. Dory suddenly remembers the past and present- short term and long term memory, but continues to claim memory problems. Also, those of you claiming this is bad for foster, adopted children- Dory was not a foster child or an adopted child. She was just lost. Of course foster children or even adopted children fantasize that they are really loved by their birth parents. So do abused children, neglected children, children of drug addicts, and orphans. It doesn't hurt anything. It is natural. It Is normal. It is in good taste. I promise that if you in some way attempt to communicate that it is wrong for your child to view this innocent, animated film: you will lose credibility with your children. If your children have yet to be informed of their adoption: you will let them know. This film is G rated."
7,Charming and amusing.,19 June 2016,"Everyone's favourite forgetful fish, Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), is back on the big screen a whopping 13 years after joining Marlin (Albert Brooks) on a quest to find his missing clownfish son. This time, however, Dory takes centre stage. Shifting the focus from Nemo to Dory for this belated follow-up is a no-brainer; it allows Pixar to concoct a new ocean-spanning adventure without feeling too repetitive, whilst cleverly bringing the broader plot full-circle by having the child now looking for the parents. Even with the huge gap between movies, there are still obstacles to be circumvented in order to avoid sequelitis. Most of these are handled with the intelligence and elegance we have come to expect from Pixar, though some hurdles prove to be too big. The story goes to very different places from both a narrative and location perspective, but the messages behind the film – don't judge a book by its cover, spontaneity can be liberating, you can do anything if you try hard enough, etc – are all too familiar. With glorious cutting-edge animation, a string of creative sequences and a barrel-full of laughs, there won't be a single audience member, regardless of age, that'll be bored; yet there's also a lack of truly memorable moments that stop this from being a classic like its predecessor. It goes without saying that Dory is the star of the show, although the range of hilarious supporting characters is impressive. Ed O'Neill's cantankerous, camouflaging octopus Hank and Ty Burrell's self-doubting beluga whale Bailey shine brightest. It might not be in the top echelon of Pixar outings, but Finding Dory is a charming, amusing and thoughtful family flick worth visiting the cinema for."
4,One Big Cliché,10 December 2016,"One huge problem about Pixar is that they have been releasing too many long awaited sequels (and a prequel) like Toy Story 3 (which was even better than One and Two), Monsters University and recently this one.PLOT: The plot is too similar to Finding Nemo. Firstly, our protagonist (Dory) gets lost, her friends (Marlin and Nemo) go on a long journey to find her, at the aquarium she makes new friends, including an octopus who wants to escape and her old friend a whaleshark, she is briefly reunited with her friends and family, she is rescued and the gang returns home with new friends. The only differences are she gets lost while looking for her lost parents,it takes place in an aquarium in California, the new friends are the octopus, the whaleshark and the orca, and in the climax she is saved from a truck.CHARACTERS: Film makers will never learn that giving the comic relief character his/her own story is not a good idea.HUMOUR:Nearly half the jokes in this film fall flat, like Sigourney Weaver is the host of the aquarium. COME ON PIXAR YOU CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT!!!! In conclusion, Finding Dory robs the audiences worth $1.056 billion worldwide and felt like remake, not a sequel."
6,Alarmingly disappointing,17 July 2016,"I thought it would be one of the best second part ever made, but to my surprise it turned to be a standard bad second part.Where is the hilarious Dory and the amazingly essential funny characters like the fish tank ones in the first movie. I just found a basic line trying to make a good story. And a boring story trying to not cross the line of disgusting. Characters that have my barely passing grade. But my predictions for this movies were so high that the failure was bigger, just like, I hoped, for all the ones who saw it 13 years ago.See it if you want to know what happens with Dory's family at any cost, but if you just have a low curiosity, just don't see it. I recommend you to see finding Nemo again.Please don't even think to make a third movie in 13 years."
6,Disappointing,7 February 2017,"The movie itself was in my opinion disappointing. Maybe it's just me being grown up (which I doubt) but the movie was just lacking so much. Didn't laugh or even smile once throughout the movie. It was just meh i didn't feel like there was any humor in the movie and there wasn't any exciting parts either. After more than 10 years from finding Nemo to this it's just disappointing. I'm not saying it's bad, i'm just saying it's not as good as expected. There wasn't any part where i felt danger or where i felt that dory getting lost was actually important at all Music didn't make me feel anything through the whole movie. Animation could've been better as well. Could probably still be a good movie for kids but for people who already watched finding Nemo and who watches lots of movies its just not worth the money"
7,Sweet and charming,5 August 2017,"If you're looking for a cute and entertaining movie to kill some time on a lazy Sunday - go 4 it. ""Finding Dory"" is a sweet and charming sequel with a bunch of wonderful dubbers (Ellen DeGeneres, Albert Brooks, Ed O'Neill) and funny allusions to ""Finding Nemo"". No more, no less!"
8,Excellent for kids,29 June 2017,"Finding Dory had the potential to be annoying, and for a certain amount of time, it feels almost laborious due to Dory's memory loss being played for effect numerous times before her long term memory kicks into gear. Once it does, the movie takes off. Dory pulls Marlin and Nemo along with her to meet another batch of interesting and funny sea creatures, as she learns where she came from, how she got lost, and where her parents got off to. It's a terrific kids movie, and has enough emotional depth to stay interesting for the adults, especially those who were kids when Finding Nemo was out in 2003, and felt the fear and apprehension of Marlin as he and Dory hunted for his lost son.There will probably not be another one of these movies, but that's fine. The story is superb, the characters are diverse and fun, and there's plenty of bright colors and beautiful visuals to go around. It's heart is, undeniably, in the right place, with new, amazing side characters that has become expected from Pixar. It just never achieves the highest emotional impact on me, like I felt many previous Pixar films have had. Pixar is great at making animated movies that have more to them than just simple kids stuff, and they've proved that over and over. It's no accident that this movie is the highest grossing animated film of all time. ---From Yidioo"
10,"I laughed, I misted u",20 June 2017,"Back to the pond for Pixar, where we find things largely unchanged from the end of 2003's Finding Nemo. As the continually-forgetful blue tang Dory has a sudden enduring flash of her childhood, a rush of recall, she gathers the clownfish for one more globe-spanning adventure. The setup is a little soft, lingering too long in the shadow of the first film, but eventually we break free of that sentiment and forge a new (if similar) identity for the sequel. The closed-in landscape of an aquatic themed zoo/amusement park feels a bit claustrophobic at first glance, but as hijinx ensue and we learn more of Dory's early years, it all fleshes out nicely. No shortage of colorful new characters there, literally and figuratively, not the least of which is Ed O'Neill's escape artist ""septipus"" (having lost a tentacle in the touch tank), who treads dangerously close to becoming a deus ex machina with his versatility. O'Neill brings his usual disgruntled pessimism to the role, though, and some genuinely clever sight gags using the creature's natural assets go a long way to smoothing that over. He's overly convenient, but we're always glad to see him again. Witty and fast-paced, with a good mix of gags for the adults and their kids, plus a potent dose of the studio's famed poignancy. I laughed, I misted up, but I never quite fooled myself into thinking it was superior to the first."
7,"Cute and funny, just like the previous movie",1 June 2017,"Finding Dory is the sequel to the successful Finding Nemo movie. The story lines of these movies are quite similar. Both Nemo and Dory are lost and their friends/family try to find them. Through some clever, not always realistic, but funny ideas the movie ends happily ever after. Finding Dory is, just like the previous movie, very funny and is enjoyable for every age. The movie is really sweet and contains a beautiful message."
7,"Charming, funny with a great message",13 May 2017,"Finding Dory is not only a gorgeous-looking animated film, but a really family fun adventure. It's cheeky, funny, cute, naughty, crazy and heart-warming. It is not specially simple or over the top, and settles in a happy medium that will please kids and a adults alike. Although this is a sequel to Finding Nemo, the story feels like a film on its own, and while some of the events and characters in the first film appear also here, Finding Dory would still be a great film even if the first movie had never been made.Finding Dory is not a film about being lost, is a film a about finding who you are and finding home. It sends a message that your family is not always just your natural family, but those who include you in their family, help and love you when you don't have anybody else and you are most vulnerable.The story also sends a very positive message to any kid who has a disability, learning problem, or is just different. Dory has a short memory span, yet that problem makes her take decisions rapidly and be fearless and resolute, lets her evaluate any situation rapidly and make the best of it; Dory needs of other people, but she is so devoted and caring, that anybody wants to help her when she's in need. The analogy for those kids who are different is wonderful -- those things that seem to be a shortcoming and make you different, might end being the source of your greatness, helping you develop great qualities, and make of you an unique lovable individual. No animated movie can pass the adults' test without having great characters and great voices. This is the case here. The characters are varied, funny, have distinct personalities, and the actors lending their voices to them do a great job at infusing them with life and soul. I enjoyed Ellen being Dory. She did a great job at infusing Dory with that charm and soul the character needs. Besides, Ellen's natural voice has those things that are quintessential Dory: naughtiness, innocence, excitement and child-like tones. I found baby Dory absolutely adorable and wonderful. Once Dory becomes an adult and Ellen's voice is more fully there, I couldn't but hear Ellen, not always Dory. I would have liked her voice to be a bit more twinkled or morphed so as to allow Dory to take Ellen over, if you know what I mean.My main criticism to the film is perhaps the fact that the story becomes inorganic when we see an octopus driving a van and a fish reading signs and driving signs. Not that I didn't enjoy it, but I thought that somewhat didn't glue well with the rest of the film.The film comes together with the short film Pipper, which I reviewed elsewhere, and adorable addition to a great combo.Most enjoyable."
10,The best Pixar sequel since Toy Story 3.,10 April 2017,"After ""Toy Story 3"" was released back in 2010, Pixar has started to put out more and more follow ups to their previous critically acclaimed films this decade. I loved the aforementioned ""Toy Story 3"", loathed ""Cars 2"" and thought ""Monsters University"" was pretty good, but not as great as the first film. So, I really didn't know what to expect with ""Finding Dory"", the sequel to one of my favorite animated movies ""Finding Nemo."" I was nervous thinking it was just going to be a film that was going to be on par with Pixar's previous film ""The Good Dinosaur"", but at the same time I was excited hoping it would be as fun and clever as ""Inside Out"". And luckily enough, it was another winning movie from Pixar. ""Finding Dory"" is a great sequel that keeps up the excitement, makes you guess where the film is going to go, and is just straight up fun and funny.One year has passed from the previous film, and out favorite short-term memory loss fish Dory (Ellen DeGeneres), finally remembers something, her family. With the location being at ""the Jewel of Morro Bay, California"", she set outs with Marlin (Albert Brooks) and Nemo (now played by Hayden Rolence) to go find her parents. When they arrive off the coast in California, Dory is captured by marine biologists and taken to a marine life institute. While she's in quarantine, she meets a very grumpy octopus, no wait a minute, septapus as he has lost a tentacle, named Hank (Ed O'Neill). She asks him to help her find her family in the institute in exchange for a tag the biologists have placed on her which would take her to an aquarium in Cleveland. Meanwhile, Marlin and Nemo are trying to figure out how to get inside the institute to find Dory through any crazy means possible.The best part of ""Finding Dory"", like most Pixar movies is the story. It's crazy fun. It's exciting, funny, emotional, suspenseful, and keeps you guessing the whole way through which is what I really expect for a movie. The animation is also a great part of the film. Just like the first movie, it's beautiful. The colors are eye popping, the underwater world is mysterious, and the institute looks like a very nice place to visit. The characters once again are to many to count. Ellen DeGeneres is great as usual, Albert Brooks is pretty great, and I especially love Ed O'Neill as Hank. This octopus can blend into almost everything, which leads to some real funny comedy. Oh yeah, speaking of the comedy, this movie is hilarious. I think I was bawling my eyes out from laughing hard at this movie and I nearly got hiccups laughing too hard. The emotion is also where it needs to be. Some scenes in this movie can be tear jerker. Even though I didn't cry watching movies, I was very close to doing so watching this film.Personally, ""Finding Dory"" is the best Pixar sequel since ""Toy Story 3"". No doubt in my mind. It could be as good if not even better than ""Finding Nemo"". I am dead serious. I really love this film. It's great. I can probably go on forever praising this movie, but I probably shouldn't. All I can say is go check it out. Trust me. It really is worth your time."
4,Enjoyable but ultimately forgettable,21 August 2016,"13 years (yes, it's been that long) since 'Finding Nemo' the talented folks at Pixar again decide to break their 'no sequel' rule and bring us 'Finding Dory'.'Cars 2' and 'Monsters University' had their moments but weren't great, so I was going into this film with low expectations.However, despite there being quite a few similarities between the plots of both films 'Finding Dory' is entertaining enough, with lots of charm and humour.I did find it a bit repetitive at times though. We lost Dory, we find Dory, then something else happens to Dory. It almost seemed as though they were padding the story out.Is 'Finding Dory' set to be a classic? No. Could you just watch 'Finding Nemo' and forget this sequel was made? Yes. But for a better than average film then this is a good one to watch."
1,Made by the gods of political correctness,2 November 2016,"This movie is about a fish 'child' with short term memory loss. Why would Pixar make a movie about a fish with short term memory loss you ask? Because it is the politically correct venue of the day. It's not meant to entertain children but to ""teach them a lesson"" of how they should treat other children whom they happen to meet that have short term memory loss, which, in any person's life time, the odds of meeting anyone with this disability is almost nil. I'm really old and have never met any. But YOU have become so brain washed by political correctness that you don't even notice when it's being thrust upon you. I say YOU because I am too old to buy into this freedom stealing bull crap. This movie doesn't deserve to be given even a 1(one) but I can't give it anything lower. Watch this and know you are losing a portion of your life that you can't get back and that you are being fed propaganda. On the other hand the CGI is outstanding so if you want to watch for that part only then turn off the sound and enjoy the CGI. 'Nuff said."
