4,Silly action movie = no masterpiece,10 June 2017,"I wanted to like Wonder Woman, but I just can't get aboard the hype train. It's really the same as every other cartoonish, overblown comic-book action movie, except with a female protagonist.Actually, this is worse than the average comic book movie, because it preaches to the audience about pacifism but then hypocritically celebrates ""heroic"" violence. In other words: Wonder Woman is an alleged pacifist who kills a bunch of people. Wonder Woman is also an alleged feminist, who allows Steve Trevor to drive the entire plot and basically steal the movie from her. Really, this thing is about as progressive as Dick Cheney's great-great grandfather.I could forgive Wonder Woman's flimsy social commentary, if it were any good in other respects. But the plot is loose and shabby, the CGI is poor, and about half the scenes were shot in front of a green screen. Sometimes, I couldn't tell if I was watching a real movie, or Patty Jenkins playing God of War on her Playstation 2. (When exactly did cinema and video games blend into this horrible hybrid art form, which has none of the beauty and charm of old-school cinema?)And don't get me started on the villains. The World War I era Germans are depicted as cartoonishly eeeevil, while the same era's British Empire is held up as a heroic ideal. Meanwhile, the main villain is a nightmare of bad CGI, who looks like he belongs on a 1980s heavy metal album cover. Naturally, they got a wonderful actor for this stupid part and wasted him entirely.Perhaps I'm going overboard on criticisms, but we need some balance to the rapturous praise this film has received. Movie fans often accuse professional critics of being too harsh, but lately, I think critics have actually become too lenient. Mainstream movies get dumber, louder and tackier all the time, and they are increasingly substituting mawkishness for real emotion and character development. And yet the critics have given this thing a great Rotten Tomatoes rating! I guess we've all lowered our standards to rock bottom?"
6,Lazy writing at its best,9 June 2017,"First of all, this movie only made money because it's a superhero movie. Everyone likes superheroes and there is no way a parent is not going to take their children to see it. Look at Transformers. Most of the movies are downright idiotic but it still makes money because it's.....Transformers. So all popular comic book hero movies will make money period. I can't make sense of the movie and I really don't think the writers knew either. Her morales flip flop, the bad guy has no real reason to be ""bad"", the good guy has no real reason to ""die."" The side characters really didn't serve much of a purpose.Some parts of the movie are decent and a few seconds later, the same scene turn into a total crapfest. The 3rd part is an utter mess and that act alone should be more then enough reason to keep WW off the top of the charts but somehow has a 94% rating on RT? That right there shows you that ratings are padded because you can't have at least 1/3 of a movie be total trash, 1/3 of the movie just corny dialog and somehow end up at the top of the charts."
1,WW = Watta Waste,12 June 2017,"Zack Snyder strikes again. He wrote the script. It shows!No character development - this is an origin story. I wanted to see how Diana becomes Wonder woman, what experiences shape her on her journey, is she ever at conflict with her values? There is no single incident that actually affects or moulds her in anyway. Diana is essentially WW at the beginning of the movie. She does not grow into or earn this role. Nothing shapes or impacts her after she is WW either. She falls in love but would she have been a different WW otherwise? NO! In Iron Man, it took 2/3 of the movie, failures and multiple iterations, for Tony Stark to become Iron Man. His experience in the cave and learning that his weapons are used by terrorists, deeply impact and change him. Spider-man has to live with the guilt of his uncle's death, learn to use his powers, understand the balance of power and responsibility. Thor is born with all the power but it takes a whole movie for him to learn what it means to be a hero. Captain America has to become a leader and earn everyone's respect. Batman, Doctor Strange... there are so many examples of origin stories. The self discovery and growth are not implied, they are core and intrinsic to the story. WW does not have this core - she has an objective which is entirely different. For this reason alone, this movie is an epic fail in my book.Themyscira: I just hated this in its entirety Weird accent. Gal Gadot couldn't fake an American accent, so they had everyone else try to talk like her. Young Diana. The primary purpose is to elicit a 'cho chweet' response. She is a demi-god. There is no self discovery... why is she different, stronger than everyone else; how does that affect her? The 'train her, don't train her' non-issue. Diana gets combat trained despite her mother (and Queen!) not consenting. The arising conflict should have taken more than 2 lines of dialogue to be resolved. This would have also impacted Diana, her mother didn't want her to learn combat and suddenly wants her to be the best. Why? This is a page right out of Zack Snyder's Martha handbook of resolving issues.Fighting. The creative decision was that Amazonians don't fight, they ballet. Every jump, swing from a rope, shooting an arrow, getting off a horse is a dance move. It just looked ridiculous.Strike a pose: WW literally poses in each and every shot. She has her shoulders pushed back like she is trying to make her shoulder blades meet. It looks unnatural and odd. The poses are the exact same as in BvS. There is...wrists crossed in front of the face, crouching behind the shield, standing in a wide stance and the jumping pose with one knee bent. And they are shot exactly the same as in BvS. They probably just reused clips. They are not poses in the middle of a range of movements. It's pose, pause for 5 secs, next pose, pause for 5, repeat.Humour: This is not comic relief. They dedicated a continuous 15-20 min segment and it all stems from the cultural differences between the Amazonians and us. The bath scene, sleeping in the boat, the secretary, the clothes trials... all stems from the same issue. It's the same material stretched for 15 mins and frankly gets tiresome.Villain: In a weak attempt to create twist, the villain is introduced late in the film. There is no time to associate with the character. The villain exists simply as someone to be fought.Final battle: Visually, this sequence is identical to the doomsday fight in BvS. If someone mashes these 2 scenes up, it will be hard to differentiate one from the other.The McGuffin: There is no reason given why WW goes into hiding. What is the entire deal with the photograph and the secrecy? There's so much focus on this but it's not resolved.Gol Gadot: O!M!G! Could there possibly be a better WW? But she's posing and grunting though the entire movie. Very off putting. Her acting skills fluctuate quite a bit too. Perhaps since her character also fluctuates. WW goes from being head strong, doing what SHE wants, to naive and easily persuaded, to emotionally distraught by the horrors of war, to a super hero that's reckless. BTW since she has no clue of the real world, how does she know if she's fighting on the right side? Also considering Amazonians are warriors, for whom battle training is the only form of recreation, why is she horrified by war?Fight Choreography: Other than the training sequence, the choreography is a close second if not at par with the fights in Captain America 2 but the slow motion ruins it completely. It's not used to accentuate the fight, every punch goes in to slo-mo. If! everything! is! accentuated! nothing! stands! out! This coupled with the grunting just spoils each fight.Chris Pine: The best thing in the movie by a mile. His is the only character given some depth and Chris Pine did justice to the role.I understand the cultural, social and contemporary significance of this movie. But that is not reason enough for me to love it. I feel it completely failed to live up to the hype, even though reviews and box office prove contrary. But there may be a silver lining here. All the hype shows the love for WW and how long overdue the movie really is. I'm hoping they are going to make another one soon and I hope it's going to be far better. Isn't that what a superhero movie is about...hope?"
1,A laughable mess in slow motion,5 June 2017,"I'm definitely the minority here, but I can't get over the fact that this film is rated higher than films like Enter the Void, Moonlight, The Kings Speech, Spotlight and sooo many other much better films. The critics took the money on this one and ran. To me, this film was cheesy, campy, and completely missed the mark. The ridiculous costume that is clearly symbolic for America ( there's clearly a fuc*ing gold eagle on her chest and it's red white and blue), yet she hails from Greece and calls herself an Amazonian God - WTF?!! AMAZONIAN!?!?!? I was so confused. Then, there is an American who is a British Spy (huh?) Most of the German Nazis speak with British accents and she can deflect bullets yet she loses her hearing to explosions.... I'm sorry, but I just could not get past this to enjoy the film. As an origin story, it's completely ludicrous. Maybe it worked back when the comic was written, but today it just comes off as a desperate attempt to pry the money from people that want to be viewed as politically correct. If you study film and take movies seriously, you should avoid a visit to the theater for this one. Watch it at home for free and make your own opinion, but I can see this media-con being laughable in 20 years."
1,IMDb has failed me.,24 June 2017,"For as long as I could remember this website was a beacon of light guiding me throughout a vast ocean of bad movies, actors and directors. Tonight, i feel disappointed. This picture was SO AWFUL I don't know even where to begin. HOW IS IT POSSIBLE that it has 8.0+ score? Gal Gadot is beautiful, sexy and physically looks like Diana Prince, but she's not an actress. Well, at least not for a character with this depth. I actually felt sorry for Chris Pine, which is the only salvageable thing in this 2h20min disaster. The movie has zero continuity, it's so bad written it makes you wonder how these guys ever got into a position to have had the chance to write something like this. It seems as an 11 year old could have written it on the car ride before school.I don't want even get started on the details, because everything major on this was wrong. From now on, I'm not sure how I'll trust IMDb again."
1,1914 it's not,2 June 2017,"I guess all the really bad Germans have been exhaustively & now boringly used up one to many times,beat dragged & tortured in the previous thousand turkey shoot WW2 movies from the Longest Day to Inglourious Basterds ... maybe having an Israeli IDF glamour girl pummel the last surviving movie Nazis seems rather unsportsmanlike.So now we have fresh meat Germans from WW1 that just aren't as Kosher as the WW2 bad-ass Nazi robotrons . It just doesn't come across as the good fight,IDF Wonder Woman against the exhausted muddy trench fighting & dying Germans of the Kaiser's Army. Wonder Woman defending the huge British Imperialist Empire against the upstart smaller German Imperialist Empire. What Empire should I root for?So duel citizenship Wonder Woman kicks Kaiser Sheev Palpatine Admirals right of the bridge off the first Allegiance-class Star Destroyer she crosses paths with...ops, wrong universe ... kicking Kaisers Wilhelm's poison gas snorting quasi-Nazis off the bridge of the nearest Zeppelin so the smaller Axis of Evil Ottoman Empire can be carved up & the righteous State of Israel formed on the back of the defeated Turkish subjects thanks to Wonder Woman!Well...basically that is the historical time-line.Hollywood writers wet dream rewrite of history since they now have picked clean the dried carcass of WW2 & can finally move on,but the sidekick American Hero going futuristic suicidal jihadi just doesn't bode well for gentlemanly slaughter of 1914. Lawrence of Arabia versus Wonder Woman might be in the works with smart-ass Shia LaBeouf as Captain Lawrence.Maybe I'm reading to much in this generic CGI feast on the eyes.but I have to as this endless stream of Marvel/DC comic green screen movies are blurring into each other .Now the original corny T.V Carter always seemed like an awkward top heavy super hero gal but Gal Gadot comes across as a sweaty Stairmaster extra & just as talented as a 10lb Dumbbell."
1,Shocked at how this movie has received good reviews.,30 June 2017,"I don't get it. I must be completely out of touch with what is popular for today's movie going public, and am scratching my head how this terrible movie receives such good reviews. This was the first movie I've been to at the cinema that I wanted to leave. I wanted to leave after 20 minutes. I decided to stay to see if things would turn around. Big mistake. I fought back the urge to get out of my seat a further two times staying till the end. One of the only things keeping me going was getting home to go online and enjoy the critics laying into this atrocious movie. Only they didn't. They loved it. Apparently this is one of the best superhero movies of the year (""slash,"") ever. If so I'm glad I've avoided most of the others. The plot and dialogue was extremely dull, and the WW11 setting didn't really take the film anywhere beyond the realms of mundane. People seem to be getting giddy about how the film represents a positive step for feminism. This again shocks me as the film seems to be quite anti-feminist in it's nature. Just because the films main character is a woman doesn't mean this film is feminist. I swear that most if not all the people who have rated this film highly have either been brainwashed, or they are idiots, I can think of no other explanation.Back to the content, and after sitting through rather lousy dialogue, we get to the part in the film where, Diana is introduced to a trio of guys who are going to help her out in her mission. And what a trio they are, they get my vote for the worst characters in any film ever and instantly took this film from a 1 out of 10 to a -2. I'm not going to name them. They are not worth it. If they weren't bad enough the villains are also exceptionally bad, a grumpy Nazi general, and a woman with a disfigured face, covered phantom of the opera style, with the moniker Dr Poison. In another film this might be a fun nickname, unfortunately the grayness of the Nazi's and the backdrops we find them in just make Dr Poison seem dull. There are a couple of fun moments in this film, like a trailers worth, and to be fair they are no means exceptional. Just plain standard. As such this is a film that has not pushed a single boundary. Spoiler (this next part reveals what happens at the end of the movie.)The worst part for me was the climatic battle at the end. It would take some extremely effective and persuasive acting for a British male mustachioed MP type to play Ares (based on the Greek God with the same name,) here we reach the films climatic failure. The fight now just seems stupid. For what, omg, that politician guy I never cared about is Ares! Facepalm. Most pointless twist ever.Superhero films seem to be popular and make a lot of money at the Box office. Hopefully one day people will wake up and stop eating this garbage, and If you think this film represents a step in the right direction for feminism you probably need your head examined."
3,Not what I expected,6 June 2017,"OK Wonder Woman review time ***Spoilers ahead***The first half of the movie was sooooo slow I had to literally hold my eyes open to prevent me from falling asleep so im not gonna talk about it. Now correct me if im wrong but this was billed as a ""summer action movie"" correct? Well when its 2:10 mins and only about 15-20 mins is actual action I have a problem with that. Don't get me wrong when she was all kickin ass and whatnot it was awesome and I dug that part a lot, thats why its saddening to me there was so little. Also on the plus side the chemistry with her and Steve was good ... so of course he dies lol. (sidenote he would have made a good Green Lantern with the chemistry they showed) On the down side, once again a very slow movie till the bunker scene (which was bad ass) and then nothing again till the final fight which again there was no real Villain presence till the last 10 mins and even then she spent half of that time fighting mustache man Ares and not God of war Ares and as we all know for me the villain makes the movie. I give it a 3/10 its not bad like Ghost Rider/Fantastic Four bad its just not what I expected or hoped for at all."
1,"Terrible movie to watch, just a Captain America ripoff.",9 June 2017,"Warning! Slight spoiler alert if you are going to watch the movie. Personally, i thought this movie was ridiculous. The entire movie was only tons and tons of filler with nothing interesting except for the three fight scenes, which were all ridiculous. Wonder Woman is to me just a ripoff of Captain America. The whole world war setting, the shield which can deflect bullets and mortar rounds, and how she can just dodge and see bullets coming, was pulled straight from Captain America. As a woman, i am an active feminist and i was glad they finally made a movie where women star in acting and directing roles. However, to me this movie falls just ahead of Catwoman in ratings. Don't waste your time and money with this movie."
1,Really?!?,3 June 2017,"I was SO excited to see this movie and thirty minutes in I was......... BORED! And there was another 110 minutes left! The acting was not great and accents seemed to change every few lines for every character. It seemed like Gal Gadot was constantly posing for a photo shoot instead of acting - I think I caught ""Blue Steel"" face a few times. Gal is gorgeous but I did not get Amazonia princess from her - could they not have found an actress with muscle? Felicity Jones in Rogue One was more Wonder Woman! Of course the movie had to throw in the bits about being beautiful AND smart - but not too smart because a man had to explain snow and she was not so Amazonian that she didn't like looking drop dead gorgeous for the guys. Nope, no Wonder Woman here - just another Hollywood ""preach it"" to the public movie only this time the super hero is thin, scantily glad, super duper smartish/childish, and condescending."
1,Awful rubbish,3 June 2017,"Saw Wonder Woman yesterday... quite frankly it's actually really bad. Story line all over shop, character development, all over the shop, main Charakter Wonder Woman stumbles through the movie like a naive 16 year old imbecile, she's a goddess for crying out loud, the logic for not telling her who she really is, screwed up and all over the shop. The way she kills Ares in the end, could have been achieved by telling her who she really was from the get go and a full 2hrs earlier, granted, it would have been a short movie but better. I'm not even getting into the feminism part of it. In Greek mythology Amazons were mainly concerned with war and were rather brutal. To be expected if they were the supposed children of Harmonia and Ares. Yet in the movie they are portrait as peace loving, just, fair, superior beings to all mankind. But also especially superior to men who are essential for procreation and useless otherwise, really?!It wouldn't have hurt if ""Wonder Woman"" would have hit the gym before filming commenced. But I guess if your main character believes that love is the ultimate answer to all of mankind problems, there's no need for that either. The rainbows one can vomit, lightning actually in this case, with all that fuzzy love feeling are blinding your opponents into oblivion, which she kinda did... there you go... The women training her in the movie looked fitter and in better shape than Gal Gadot despite being twice her age, at least in the movie. All this seemed like a bad parody of Thor and captain America, without the humour, without a plot, and atrociously bad acting from an otherwise good cast. So all this really is, a quick money maker with main selling point: ""Female Lead"" I am all for women kicking ass, in movies as a well as real life, here however, to me, it's all to artificial and contrived. For example, in iron man one can believe the change Stark is going through, for one, out of necessity,shrapnel in his chest, for the other he decided to use his wealth for the good because he actually sees what his weapons are causing. Captain America, he's full of idealistic ""Americaness"" alright but is cool, most important the character does not come across as naive. WW did not need to be so clueless. As far as the plot goes she's naive because she was sheltered from the world, fine, but yet she had access to literature about how Humans procreate but not about how the world outside her realm operates? And the character seemed to struggle almost seems to resist to accept the reality she finds herself in. Whereas good old captain America, after 70 years of sleep, just keeps kicking ass. Her character development seems awkwardly written. To me, the biggest disservice to the movie. Overall the movie also felt sadly discombobulated. And then there is the WWI one setting... no one is expecting historic accuracy here, however, to try to glorify or find good in something that was so absolute and inherently not good. More specific to bring in the gas, as was used in WWI on a massive scale for the first time in modern warfare on top WWI having been a downright horror show in recent human history, dunno mate, it's bound to fail in a movie like that.Marvel also incorporated WWII in Capo America, but didn't even try to bring in the concentration camps for example, it would have opened a can of worms the audience wouldn't have bought and it's not what captain America was about. Also the narrative flow is way better with Marvel I find."
10,Diana is Anti-Nazi Hero of Today! Historical Revisionist Entertainment!,5 October 2017,"What I surprised to see was the historical revisionism that successfully became ideological essence of the blockbuster entertainment of today!
 Diana is the most beautiful girl who can only defeat demons in Nazi-like German military uniforms during the World War I! WW1 Germans are equalised with Nazis in WW2 in this American comic film for Jewish heroism. 
The Christian view of the world is quite clear, and the historical view on WWI Germans is as same as WW2 Nazis in films. It seemed to be Anti-Nazism. This is a typical propaganda essence among westernised movies mainly made by Jewish origin filmmakers. Anti-Nazis should not to be anti-Germans. 
However, it is just a good entertainment but not a historical text book at all. We can say that this is a successful live-action comic book. 
Furthermore, this also can be seemed as a feminist film of today and the ideology became the blockbuster entertainment to spread around the world. This is not a bad thing!"
5,Highly overrated movie,24 June 2017,"So I decided to go and see the movie because 8.1 is such a good rate in IMDb. And seriously, what could be better than a hot girl with superpowers killing Nazis. However when I was seeing it I felt that it just was another superhero's movie with nothing to offer more than the same poor structure of the majority of bad superhero's movies: a half naive hero finding her path to kill an evil character that is the responsible of all the bad stuff happening in the world. In the mean time, the hero decides to believe in clichés like ""find love"" and ""everything is about what you believe"" and while she win the knowledge of those clichés, by very poor reasoning by the way, she increases her power to kill the evil character. So it was an extremely predictable movie that we all have seen 80 times but with a hot girl in it. Besides, the rules of the game were never clear, for example: at the end of the movie she decides to forgive the life of a German person because it was the right thing to do and she was so just and good, but during all the movie she was killing people, so one never understands where were the line between the good and the bad, the only thing that helps you to understand the line between the good and the evil was that in one side you had giggling English men and in the other side you had enraged Nazis. And on top of that, the characterization of Ares during the movie is just painful, they put it like a demon that believes that humanity is substantially bad and that they should kill each other for that, but Ares is the god of war and it also means understanding honor, courage and the beauty of the fight, which is very far from the Nazi's horrors. If Ares didn't exist, the Wonder Woman couldn't exist either because she is a character built on the vigor of war. I give it a few stars because the build up of the beginning was actually cool and kind of funny."
3,An Unfunny Comedy of Errors,1 June 2017,"First of all, I'm a woman and I'm pro gender equality and both men's and women's rights.. and no this is not about armpit hair or female power. I don't think art owes anyone anything. Here's why this movie sucks on its own merits: 1- Out of all the Amazonians in the movie, Gal Gadot looks the weakest and least fight- ready. She could've hit the gym as in her current physique compared to women twice her age in the movie she looks like the one who had to sleep with the coach to make the team. Her having the only Hamstrings that swing like jelly amid a fight scene full of women in their fifties makes you wonder. 2- Choosing the First World War as a background was a horrible idea! I felt I was watching a war movie gone bad. Depressing, ugly, frustrating and sad to watch to the point of distraction. What happened in WWI was too tragic even for a superhero to fix. Terrible juxtaposition insulting the sensibility of any person who read anything of value about that war. 3- The introduction of how brave a child she was, was way too lengthy and culminating into some of the most stupid scenes I've ever watched. All that hogwash about not telling Wonderwoman who she ""really"" was ends up getting on your nerves. 4- She sees a mortal from earth for the very first time and all the movie has to allude to in their early conversations is his (according to him) ""above average"" penis??? Come on! 5- She was annoyingly naive! More like wonder sissy not wonder WOMAN. Hissy fits ooh take me to your leader! 6- The God of war, the super evil devil like character she has to fight is an elderly guy completely out of shape and appears to be more like the God of Arthritis. I thought Gods don't age judging by the fact that she doesn't! Only male Gods do? Now that's sexist. 7- I would like to register here my great disdain (eff you Hollywood) for making the villain in the movie someone with a scarred face. So pretty people can't be villains? In fact all the villains are either old, fat or scarred. 8- My second eff you Hollywood moment came when the spy object of wonder ""woman""'s (she was a virgin in the movie so please take note) affection decides to save the world by flying away in a plane loaded with all the lethal gas grenades but lo and behold instead of a million sane solutions he decides to commit suicide for the cause making the plane explode in the air with him in it. I thought this is pretty much the same Jihadi principle of heroic suicide!! Bad, bad, bad! Not to mention that such gas would kill people anyway in that nearby village they were banging on about the entire time. I'm not even gonna go over the scientific bullshit this movie is full of and historical inaccuracies, or plain stupidity because boy oh boy that will take all night .. but just one thing because it's really REALLY getting on my nerves... how does a woman stuff a long sword down the back of revealing dress having the blade go all the way down her ass (if that's even possible at all), then a villain wraps his arm around her back to dance without feeling it? Have the idiots who wrote this scene ever held or seen a real sword? Do they know real swords aren't bendy? Wtf? 9- I'm not sure why there was a Red Indian guy in the British barracks helping an English spy. Why Red Indian? Bring in the Chinese community because the actor looks Chinese? Method in the madness or just madness? 10- The fight scenes are lame and boring. Really boring! In one instance they had to speed the frame to make Gadot look like she's doing something and they didn't even bother mask the fact the scene was sped up digitally. 11- If Wonder ""woman"" kills the god of war making all the German soldiers have an awakening kissing and hugging each other in great relief they just lost (criiiiinnnggggeee moment), how come WWII started only 19 years later? Did they think we will just forget about that one because it's only a movie? Why not choose the background to be WWII so it'll make more sense (if that's even possible for this movie?) ... 12- I felt I was watching an American wrestling WWF show gone really bad... at one point, the men actually give Wonder ""woman"" a simple leg up for her to fly high in the air to destroy a tower with her bare fist. Which reminds me, my husband needs me to help give his nuclear rocket a piggyback ride into outer space, so I'll talk to you later."
5,"Underwhelming, Not Buying into the Hype",7 June 2017,"I disagree with the hype. Spoilers WARNING...The script was pedestrian; the pace was scattered (too fast in the beginning, and too slow when putting the team together); the logic was heavily flawed (one night on a small sailboat in the middle of the ocean with no indication of where they were and you're in London the next morning? One person/Diana single- handedly suppresses a whole front line of gunfire with her shield and wrist-cuffs? A German sniper repeatedly missing multiple non-moving and completely exposed targets? Steve's team of mostly non-soldiers barging through a German camp without much resistance? A spy able to just blow up a whole camp by himself in broad daylight on the fly without being discrete?); wasted/under-explored story lines (Dr. Poison under-explored; Steve's friend, who's supposedly a deadly sniper, unable to shoot, huh?); the motivations/rationale for some of the characters' decisions were a stretch, if not unconvincing (Wonder Woman's mom initially not permitting WW to be trained in combat, especially when we found later in the movie that WW is the God Killer? Steve insisting on going after the German general while armistice was being negotiated? Team just decides to continue fighting without further pay after initially clamoring for money while nothing happens in the process that shows they're moved by something other than money?); unexplained parts that the audience is simply expected to accept (power of the wrist cuffs was never explained; Dr. Poison loses her notebook, but all of a sudden, just conveniently finds a scrap of paper that turned on the light bulb for her; Steve's conversation with Dr. Poison at the gala about seeing her experiment didn't make much sense at all). There are more other issues with this film, but there are more than enough listed above already. All in all, I saw way too many flaws in this film to agree with any of the hype."
1,Terrible Film,8 June 2017,"seriously!? this movie deserves nothing more than 5 out of 10 stars. Terrible film. Acting was horrible. Story made little to no sense at all. Action was mediocre at best.. people need to realize that being politically correct doesn't require you to give this film a good rating. 1) the amount of cuts used was unbearable. When a director uses a lot of cuts, its usually because the scenes are action packed with timeless stunts. The stunts shown should not have required so many cuts. 2) the story was extremely rushed and left with plenty of plot holes. There was no introduction to her powers. just oh Zeus made you perfect. We do not know exactly what powers you have just that you're a god killer. Wonder Woman knows nothing about the political side of the war but automatically assumes with no good reason provided to her that the Germans are the bad guys.... what!? how is it we see her growing up as a child, then all of sudden stop aging. for a 100 years.... (WW1 ended 1918... she was using a tablet. 2017 technology)3) due to what i believe was a terrible script, the acting was horrendous."
2,"Okayish, but moving too fast with bad CGI",6 June 2017,"So, okay, this is a better movie then Suicide Squad (duh!) and it is an enormous leap forward from the absolute horrific stupidity of BvS, but is WonderWoman really a good movie? Well, nah, not really. It is decently entertaining and it does have several redeeming traits, but sadly not a very good movie. Let us start with the bad. The CGI is horribly bad. It is so obvious and so badly done I keep wondering if this movie was made in the early 1990's. I saw this movie the day after seeing Agents of Shield season finale, and AoS had 10-times better CGI. Did they not get money to do a WW movie? The story moves way, way too fast, throughout the movie. They jump from this to this and there is no time to breath, catch up with characters or develop any sense of location. It feels like this movie should have been 2 hours longer and I can only assume it was cut down to fit the American public that love fast pace action set pieces. Diana is a kid, swhoosh, Diana is training, swoosh, Germans are evil and let this Jewish woman go kill them for some reason. Then they jump on a boat and faster than The Flash they are in London, and then swoosh they are in the war, then dancing and then off fighting and whopidoda the movie is over. I got the feeling I was fast forwarding 10-15min all the time. Did they cut out 2 hours? Was the script this bad? The villains were pretty boring and badly flushed out. People keep complaining about Marvel villains, but this was far worse and in a fast pace movie like this you really do need to feel the strength and power and immense danger of the villain(s), but in this movie you do not. Not at all.I also need to mention that I hate that the ""hero"" is fighting the poor Germans in WW1, of course the central powers and Germans were the good guys in WW1 (as far as such things goes in a world war), but the propaganda must go onThe good? Well, Gal Gadot is good as WW, most of the supporting characters are good as well. Most of the action, if you can ignore the bad CGI, is good. The general story, if ignoring all the plot holes, is compelling and there are a lot of fun and great moments in this movie. There is a good/great movie here somewhere, but it is cut away and hidden under badness. If you can relax and just enjoy the ride and not let the bad elements mention above take you too much out of the movie this is okayish. I give the movie a 4 out of 10. It is entertaining after all, but not as good as Man of Steel which is still (to me) the best of the DC movies and also, strangely enough, the DC movie with least Christ-imagery Are all DC characters supposed to be God? Or Gods? Is that the point? Boring. Edit: Just saw the movie again last night and having time to focus on the movie and how good/bad it is, I detected a lot of other issues, inconsistencies and weirdo plot holes I missed the first time around. Consequently I will lower my score to a 3 out of 10."
7,A review from an older guy who is not a huge fan of superhero films.,4 June 2017,"Whether or not you'll love ""Wonder Woman"" no doubt will depend on the individual. The die-hard superhero film lovers have embraced the picture and it's setting box office records...and these folks really shouldn't read or pay much attention to my review. This is because I am over 50 and got tired of the genre long, long ago. I went to quite a few of the films because my daughters love them and this time was was actually taken to the theater by my wife, as she loves the idea of a female superhero. So, if you fall into my demographics...this review is for you!The story is pretty different from my concept for ""Wonder Woman"". This is NOT a complaint...I know a lot of superhero stuff changes. But instead of the WWII setting I expected, the film was set during the final days of WWI. The history teacher in me was intrigued...especially since they actually got the look of the film just right--costumes, airplanes, soldiers, etc.. They also heightened the bleakness of the era by severely restricting the color palate to shades of gray and brown--even the reds looked rather brown. I think this was a good choice...after all, war is horrible. Overall, there really wasn't much to dislike about the film. It had TONS of CGI and action...and that is what many fans want. As for me, I would have liked a bit less and more focus on story....but that is a very typical complaint for folks like me! However, if you do get pulled into going to see it, it won't bore you and offers a few nice twists.By the way, if you saw the film as well, were you ALSO horribly disappointed when the lady scientist's mask came off like I was?! I was expecting so much worse."
1,"clichéd, under-performed mess.",22 June 2017,"How is it that these days a movie like this can be made? I'll tell you why. It's simply another money grab!The main actor runs around casually lifting her arms up now and then to deflect bullets. First of all, she never even trained for that! She practiced sword-fighting and athletics, and suddenly she can follow bullets using eyesight and deflect them? She's also acting like her mind is miles away. ""Do I even look good while doing this?"" ""What would my friends and family say when they see me in this suit?"" ""Omg, I'm going to be so famous!"" Girl, get your head straight. You're ruining your performance by not being in it!The fighting scenes are very poorly choreographed, it's almost as bad as Jessica Jones.Story line is full with holes and one big cliché. Girl discovers her powers, finds a handsome guy, falls in love and follows him while pretending to go out and save the world because it fits the story. Handsome guy dies, fueling her rage so she can kill the bad guy. It's almost like this travesty of a movie rolled out of a factory. There's even a sex scene to top it of, even though Wonder Woman tells the handsome guy that they don't need men to pleasure themselves. Feminists must have loved that scene...The handsome guy is way to under-explained, so are his buddies. I never cared for them at all. But whatever right? After all, I should be looking at WW. But the sad fact is, I don't care for her either! We see a few scenes with her as a little girl, and a few scenes with her as an adult before she goes out and steals the so called ""God Killer"" to run of with her new boyfriend.Now, I don't know anything about WW, but this ""God Killer"" is supposedly an ancient magical sword to be used against Ares, the bad god. This actually made sense if it wasn't for the fact that it's a dud, and the true ""God Killer"" is WW herself. Surprise! And her mother obviously knows this, so she doesn't even care to make sure WW actually has the sword before she almost callously waves her only daughter farewell forever. In turn, WW herself doesn't care for her mother enough to reassure her she has the sword which would give her at least a fighting chance against Ares. This complete disregard of the sword, and emotionless farewell ruined the whole movie for me. Everything else simply added to my frustration.She apparently knows all about the outside world, speaks like 2 dozen languages, knows all about sex without ever having had a real man in her life, but then acts like a little lost girl when she arrives in London. Apparently they forgot to educate her on ""modern"" society and how to conceal a sword and shield. And while we're at it, they also forgot to educate her about the world war that's been ravaging humankind. I mean, what the hell is that?! How do you protect humankind without knowing what's going on? Without ever having the chance to return home once you leave for battle? This is too stupid to even discuss.Whatever..."
4,Am I taking crazy pills?,2 June 2017,"This movie was average, at best. Really poor acting on Gal Gadots part. The story was very predictable, CGI was poor, and the story was phoned in. I really couldn't care less about any of the characters, and there actions were incredible illogical. I had hope with a twist at the end that it would get better, but once again, it just fell flat."
3,Am I the only one who hated this film?,9 June 2017,"My dislike of it could be understandable since I dislike superhero movies for some reason; they just bore me. I'm not the biggest fan of action but I prefer a little action in stories.This movie starts off with Diana reminiscing about her 5-year-old self. She wants to train in fighting and even recklessly jumped off a ledge.Later, the movie time-skips to a pre-teen Diana in disbelief about what she's supposed to be doing.I dislike dramas and not that big on war films so that's three things this movie has that I don't like. The action was too fast for my brain to handle (I don't know what they put in those scenes to make it hard to keep up with) This movie had too much crying and sadness from people in it for me. Even an annoying baby crying voice. The melodrama this movie had made me cringe and get nervous and this is the first film I walked out on. I don't like wasting money on movies but mommy and a therapist told me if a movie starts to make me nervous, I can leave.This is the worst movie so far that I've seen in 2017 and that's saying a lot since Snatched could be considered the worst from the general public but I don't know Amy Schummer enough, nor do I have a disdain for her to hate it like other people do. But it was also not that good of a movie anyway so I could kind of understand why people don't like it."
1,"If you can think intelligently, this movie is not right for you.",2 June 2017,"I really do not understand how this movie is being hailed as the ""best superhero movie of the year"" or the DCEU comeback to Marvel. This movie's script is terrible, especially the ending, which makes absolutely no sense (I will explain in the spoilers portion below.) It also doesn't really do anything to develop the characters. When they do take a minute to say something about someone or add a little character into themselves, POOF! They're gone, not likely to return. I can't really blame the actors and actresses here for anything because they try to work with what they got. Unfortunately, the script does nothing to help them along. That makes the dialog bland and cliché and drags the movie down even more.Regarding the technical effects, they were OK. The CGI in the fight scenes had some really awkward looking shots, which made them look really manufactured. This is especially true in some of the sliding attacks. I almost wish that they utilized wire-fu/Hong Kong effects a little more in these types of movies as it looks more graceful and less ""weird"".Overall, I say skip this one. There are better superhero movies out there and coming soon. Spending your money on this will just make you wish you had your money back afterwards.--Stop here if you do not want to read SPOILERS-- --Stop here if you do not want to read SPOILERS--OK, let's get to why the ending sucks so bad. If you understand how anything works, you will instantly disbelieve the decision of Steve Trevor to blow himself up in the plane. It makes absolutely no sense other than to anger Wonder Woman, which was already done with the shell hitting Veld and the flashback Ares shows her. Also, there are many ways that Steve could have resolved the situation without killing himself. First, he is in Belgium, so when the plane takes off, he could simply fly out into the water, drop the bombs into the ocean, then land the plane, either back in Belgium or in England. Second, they could shoot out the tires or the engines on the plane, making it impossible to fly. Third, he could simply radio the Allies from the plane, or tell the other guys to call (they did this earlier) and land in France. Any of these would have worked as he had control of the plane.The second issue I had is the gas itself. They spout on about how blowing up the plane will effectively make a 50 sq mi. gas cloud, but not a minute or two later, the factory and everything around it is being destroyed. I'm sure there were still a few bombs left in there, yet everyone seemed just fine afterwards. Also, why in the world were guards walking around with gas masks when the gas was inside the bombs already? They drilled it into our heads about how the gas masks wouldn't work against it, yet the guards still decided to put them on? It's just dumb. Add in the fact that mustard gas is a blister agent, with no one in the town showing blisters, as well as the fact that they magically produce tons of this stuff in less than 24 hours for the big bomber and it is stupidly laughable.What gets me the most about these logic issues are that it's the non-superhero stuff that they messed up on. You had two people (gods) flying and fighting in the air during the climax of this movie and, truth be told, that was more acceptable and believable to the story than a pilot getting into a bomber and blowing himself up. Honestly, skip this one."
8,Inspirational and heart-wrenching,4 June 2017,"It's no secret that the DCEU had a rough start. I personally did not like Suicide Squad or Man of Steel and, although I enjoyed Batman vs. Superman, I know that it is not a very good movie. Wonder Woman needed to be good. This universe was in dire need of a win and they absolutely got one with this movie.First off, Wonder Woman herself was absolutely brilliant in this film. She was bright, hopeful, and innocent and was unbelievably likable. Gal Gadot played her wonderfully and I cannot wait to see more of her. I really felt that I had connected with this character on so many levels. Chris Pine's character was not particularly deep, but I still cared about him and loved his relationship with Diana Prince. They had fantastic chemistry and the way that they taught each other about each other's worlds was brilliant and made for some excellent comedy as well. I was incredibly saddened when Chris Pine's character sacrificed himself at the end of the film and Wonder Woman's tear- jerking reaction was very emotionally involving.The action was fantastic, but that was no surprise since it looked so good in the trailers. The World War I sequence was ridiculously entertaining and I wish I could have seen more of it. The final sequence with Ares was also extremely exciting.My favorite scene in the film was when Steve warned Diana not to cross No Man's Land and she climbs the ladder anyway. I got goosebumps all over and was on the edge of my seat. That scene was Grade-A filmmaking. Wonder Woman is extremely inspirational in this movie and that scene embodies her character. Scenes like that were the most memorable for me. As awesome as the action was, the moments that flesh out her character and her relationship with Steve were the best part of the film.My main issues with the film mostly involve the villains. Dr. Poison seemed like she would be an intriguing character, but felt very bland and the movie never revealed what her true motivations were. General Ludendorff was an actual person in WWI, but his presence felt somewhat unnecessary and I did not feel that he was a great villain. The gas that he used to give him strength was also not needed and felt utterly pointless and out of place in the movie. I liked Ares, but the reveal of who his character actually was somewhat cheap. His motivations for showing the ugly side of humanity were very similar to Heath Ledger's Joker and I did enjoy that. My other main negative was that I also would have liked more emotional moments while Wonder Woman was on Themyscira, but I was satisfied with what we got in that particular part of the movie. Another great element of this movie was the fact that it stands on its own. There's no forced reveal of any of the Justice League characters nor is there an unnecessary setup for that movie. You could argue that this is because of the time period that this movie takes place in, but I think that Patty Jenkins really wanted to make a film that was separated from the other DCEU movies. I absolutely loved the opening scene in which she opens up a suitcase from Bruce Wayne and views the picture of her from WWI. It was the perfect way to tie the film into DCEU without going overboard. It was also the perfect way to set the stage for Diana Prince's story. The closing scene where she thanked Wayne via Email was also cool. The movie is also incredibly well-directed. Patty Jenkins is a true talent and I look forward to seeing what else she does in the DCEU and beyond. The movie is colorful, vibrant, and lively and looks utterly gorgeous. I loved the stark contrast between the clean, tropical Themyscira and the dirty, war-torn locations outside of it. Overall, Wonder Woman really gave the DCEU the push it needed. Wonder Woman now has a fantastic backstory which will really add to her character going forward. I cannot wait to see this character in Justice League and I look forward to seeing the movie many more times.8/10 Grade: A-"
1,Impulsive and Stupid Wonder Woman,13 June 2017,"I'm not going to get into the generalities of why this movie was terrible, I'm going to be very specific about scenes that left a bad taste.1. Wonder Woman's aunt sacrifices her life so that WW doesn't get shot from behind early in the movie. Later in the movie the villain tells her she's a god and only a god can kill a god. This renders her aunt's sacrifice an act of suicide because the movie went out of its way to tell the audience that all the Amazon Women knew she was a god. 2. WW's mom, the queen, tells everyone not to do something only to have everyone disobey her. Not just once, but EVERY time she says don't do something, someone does exactly the opposite. I.E. Don't train my daughter to fight, don't let this guy leave the island, don't go with the guy leaving the island. 3. WW essentially causes every innocent death in the movie. She leads a battalion through 'no mans land' and liberates a town. Then everyone in the town is killed by a gas attack that only targeted the town because it was liberated.4. WW is incredibly impulsive and stupidly clings to mythology rather than listen to many people try to reason with her. Chris Pine repeatedly tells her to wait for him and she does the opposite. Wait outside this door, she goes in. I'm going to sneak into this castle in disguise, she shows up in an evening gown and blows up his plan. He tells her killing one guy won't stop the London gas attack. She runs off and kills that guy only to freak out on Pine because she was wrong. 5. Chris Pine's character commits suicide for no reason. He steals the airplane with the poison gas (which is conveniently flammable gas) and shoots it while he's flying mid-air; sacrificing himself to dispose of the gas. If he only thought to look for a parachute he could have left a grenade in the plane and jumped out. OR he could have asked WW for one second of help; instead he tells her he loves her.All and all the movie is a cluster F and signals the entire DC Universe is going down in flames under this leadership."
8,A good film,22 October 2017,Looking at these reviews i felt i had to write one myself. All i see is marvel fans saying how bad this film is.Trust me this is a good watch i watched in cinema and at home both times i enjoyed.the beginning is a good introduction of wonder woman and the Amazonians.If you are looking for a good action film with a good cast and story this is it. The scenery is amazing and the action scenes look amazing there are even funny scenes in this film.Don't listen to the haters who feel threatened by this film just watch and enjoy as i have and others.
1,"Sitting in a room full of people, watching a blockbuster and feeling utterly bored...",18 June 2017,"I am careful these days. I don't generally trust overwhelmingly good reviews and let myself be lured into the cinema by high ratings, but somehow I fell for the high score for Wonder Woman here on IMDb.Maybe I wanted to be pleasantly surprised. Maybe I thought this could be the exception to the rule. At least, I didn't expect to be utterly disappointed and bored. Where to begin? - - SPOILERS AHEAD - - - The only thing I liked about this movie was the early action sequence on the beach. I thought the clash between the Amazonians and the WW1 soldiers was well made.Here are the things I didn't like:All the clicheés - 1. Not telling Diana who her father is 2. the 'train in secret' clichée 3. the 'average' joke 4. the dressing montage 5. the evil German killing his own men/how cartoonishly evil he wasthe scarred, evil scientist that looks for a formula. 6. the unnecessary heightening of the evil guy's strength 7. the 'oh, Wonder Woman is so stunning' by every man in the movie 8. the late predictable reveal of who Ares is etc.The whole time I was watching, I couldn't help thinking that this movie should have been called 'Steve Trevor' instead. He is the only one with a little character development, motivation and plot. I hated that Wonder Woman was basically just following him around, deciding in the worst moment to do something foolish and run into a hail of bullets just to later lose what she fought for in that instance, then lose faith in an anticlimactic moment, after seemingly having reached her goal.For a movie that wants to be progressive, it spent an awful amount of time commenting on how Diana was never dressed for the occasion. First in London, then at the gala in Germany. And you know what? I felt bored. Really, really bored. No gripping story, main character or action.The CGI was silly (lasso, bad guy's face, WW in some shots). The deflecting of the bullets was silly. The destruction of the tower and other brickwork was silly. The sword in the dress was silly. The resolution of the movie was silly. If this review helps to stop only one person from spending money on expensive cinema tickets and popcorn, raises doubt in the mind of only one young writer about the quality of Hollywood scripts, makes only one person wonder if we have really come this far from 1950 sexist comic Wonder Woman becoming the Justice Leauge's honorary member and secretary, then I can call myself lucky."
1,Bad on all fronts (Spoilers below),8 June 2017,"The movie is filled with cgi effects that are all around bad. Physics seems to just disappear and shots look awkward. Characters gets introduced, characters that give no further development to the story and are portrayed as stereotypes (drunk Irishman, the Indian, etc.). Furthermore all the Germans are portrayed as an incarnation of Hitler himself, the story tells that only Germans use gas and only Germans kill.The antagonists are boring and the story is so stupid and predictable that it ruins the whole movie. But the thing that bothers me the most is the most idiotic ending.The main ""twist"" is that Ares isn't the one making humanity evil, but rather mankind itself. This is totally forgotten when WW kills Ares and the German army suddenly drops their weapons and everything is all happy. (note that this ending is less than 20 minutes after it's explained that Ares isn't the bad guy)The portrayal of WWI is so bad that I wonder if the writer did any research at all. Lastly the story is filled with plot holes and redundant scenes.DO NOT WATCH THIS CRAP"
2,Seriously DCEU?? Definitely not the best one of the year !! Whatever Marvel gets right DC gets it wrong again and again.,6 June 2017,"I am a huge fan of Superhero movies and i had to say i was pretty excited for this one!! But just like every DCEU movie since Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy its just bad script and worse directing!!Lets get to the movie now!! It started off really well and Themyscira was portrayed in a beautiful and untouched by modern era and they got it right.Stunning visuals and waterfalls and they showed us how Princess Diana is a ""FIGHTER"" by heart and always wanted to fight for what is right.Amazonian women were portrayed as strong and intelligent women which was conveyed through the initial few scenes. Just like every other stereotypical Superhero movie she will become a bad-ass within 10-15 minutes of the movie defeating everyone and uses her braces and unleashes a mega shock-wave accidentally.They don't show her using it again in the movie where she could have !!!! Here they mention something about her heritage and nobody has a clue what the hell was going on!!Then she rescues the ""Dude in distress"" ....Steve Trevor and the movie just slows down to a pace just like the boat they set out to get out of Themyscira!! Few people die during the beach invasion as expected and a couple of scenes made me go Woahh but other than that quite forgettable.Gal Gadot was really good at portraying Wonder Woman and behaves much like Thor when he enters Earth. Doesn't know the curtsies or the rules of the outside world.She was convincing as an intelligent woman who spoke more than 100 languages!! Throw in few more scenes of rescuing Steve Trevor from German spies.Here again they could have had some bad-ass action sequences but they didn't.Finally as in every other Superhero movies the hero goes and fights the bad guys...was waiting for this for so long and this was just before the break. On the way the heroes party(Steve Trevor and WW) is joined by a couple of forgettable characters who were there clearly to add some laughs but didn't actually workout. one flaw i found here was Germans conversing with each other in English with bad accents. The casting choice for Ludendorff was really bad.Danny Huston was horrible as a German Military Officer and they keep calling their head ""KAISER"" which was how Germans referred to their head during World War One-according to the comics that's when actually Steve Trevor and Princess Diana meet not during World War 2.We will skip to the Final Act because the scenes in between are really forgettable . The action sequences were so bad and the CGI was laughable at certain points.It looked like a video game at one point.Final Act dropping the bombs in London.This is when the BS hit the ceiling!! Diana kills Ludendorff thinking he was ARES-but boy was she wrong!! Psych-It was the well mannered British Guy....ooh mind blown....NOT!!!! Another typical fight scene where everything almost seems out of hands and defeat for the hero and the entourage but through some act of human behavior the Superhero gains strength to kick the bad guy back to his place. Here again she doesn't use her powerful braces for the main villain!!!Overall a really OVER hyped ,Cliched,Poorly directed,badly cast with a horrible story well of course Zack Snyder was involved what else did people expect the Story to be!!"
1,"Good in action but same old, same old plot",5 June 2017,"Okay, Wonder Woman is now a huge success and not only that but the new front of the DCEU. The action is spectacular, the fighting is nice but what this movie fails in is the loopholes of the plot. Ares was cast down by Zeus and the Amazonians were isolated into a tropical paradise yet we are not clearly given a connection between the two incidents as to why. Then, we get a lousy plot about how Wonder Woman leaves of to London just because she thinks Ares is the reason for the war. Diana's mother confides with someone else to not tell Diana that she is a god killer, but this is said when she leaves so what's the point? Then starts a typical war story where the heroes win a battle, then again see innocents die because of a man's mistake and the man sacrificing himself so the other's can live. Okay I get that they were trying to make him a hero but come on, this is it? The plot stinks... so many typical plot points are used uselessly to bring out a stubborn biopic of a god, at least the scenes are interconnected but other than that its useless. It's not BvS bad but it's near Fantastic Four bad... Definitely another DC movie to evade, not different from Suicide Squad when it comes to clichés.."
1,Best DCEU movie yet--still doesn't say much,5 June 2017,"Grade: 6.2/10, D+ 1/10I'll just say it: Wasn't as terrible as I was expecting, but it was still pretty lame. Not good by any stretch of the imagination, but far better than anything DC has put out thus far. Patty Jenkins needs to be given a pat on the back for giving DC it's first non-vomit-inducing movie. Still, I wish WB would give us a superhero movie worthy of 2017 and not 1987.Gal Gadot did surprise me, though. When she wasn't TRYING to act, she actually gave a good performance. The problem was, the rest of the time she was trying to act, and it showed horribly. And it did not help that EVERY, SINGLE action scene she was in that wasn't CGI'd was done in slow motion. When she moved fast, it was always from behind and you could tell that it wasn't an actual person. She still showed little emotion when she talked, reminding me of a contestant in a Miss Universe contest giving canned answers to stupid questions.Chris Pine was Chris Pine. Nothing good or bad about that. He turned in the most solid performance of the entire cast, but even he felt to me like he couldn't believe he signed up for this movie or the DCEU in general. Probably had high hopes before the BvS reviews started piling in. He did the best he could with what he was given to work with.Danny Huston overacted so much in this movie. There wasn't a single scene he was in that didn't make me cringe (funny, because I was expecting to cringe during all of Gal Gadot's scenes, and I only cringed through the scenes where she talked).The secondary characters who made up Steve Rogers--er, I mean Steve Trevor's Howling Command--er, little group were nothing special. I mean, literally, they served no purpose that I could see in this movie at all.The plot was nothing special. I've seen the three acts of the movie done in other movies and done much better than here. The first act on Themyscira was kinda terrible, with every Amazon speaking in a really thick accent to cover for Diana's. It made them sound clunky and not graceful, like you would hope Amazons would be. We got a brief history of the Amazons shown an an ancient iPad which just made made me roll my eyes. It was very reminiscent of the way Zod told Kal-El about Krypton in Man of Steel, just not as well done. And Themyscira was pretty, but Asgard in Thor was definitely more amazing. Also, they did not explain how Steve broke through the protective barrier surrounding the island. I suppose it was because Ares was back, but something somewhere might have helped.The second act took place in London and Germany, and again, while it was done well, it was done better in Captain America: The First Avenger. But I will say the No Man's Land scene was probably my favorite part of the movie, and Gal's warehouse scene did put Batman's in BvS to shame. The third act was your basic CGI monster that you see in most superhero movies nowadays, but Ares wasn't terrible like Doomsday. But after seeing the final battle, it made me ask myself ""If Wonder Woman could do this, why did Superman have to sacrifice himself in BvS when Wonder Woman could have torn Doomsday to shreds"" so there is no consistency in her power.The music was decent but kinda forgettable. They, of course, had the Wonder Woman riff play during the warehouse scene, but that was the only thing noticeable that I remember. Cinematography was decent and the CGI was good other than on Themyscira which just didn't seem to fit tonally with the rest of the movie. Pacing was decent, too. I didn't really feel like falling asleep, and while I think the movie could have dealt with a bit of editing, the only thing they could take out was much-needed character development--though they really could have done without Steve trying to explain sex and marriage to Diana.If you liked the DCEU so far, you'll love Wonder Woman. If you hated the DCEU so far, you'll probably find it meh and not worth ever seeing again--and maybe not even the price of admission. I got to see it for free, so I'm not really complaining. I don't want my money back, but if I could go back in time, I'd tell myself not to see the movie to begin with, even for free."
1,Wonder Woman single-handedly ends WW1.,23 June 2017,"Is it just me or are the movies from Hollywood getting worse and worse? This movie was actually so bad that I felt the need to create an account here to review it and hopefully save a lot of people from wasting their money.Where to start... The whole movie is a complete mess and the plot seems to lack any logic.First off the movie was marketed as being about a strong female lead character to counter the never ending movies about men. This is a welcoming change in the movie industry but just like the recent ghost busters movie it really fell short. I was expecting a kick ass character like Ripley from Alien but instead we get this naive young women that needs to get told by the male lead character what to do. The plot was actually carried by men throughout the movie and instead of a movie empowering women it was a movie with the usual gender roles.Anyway I knew from the first scene that the movie was going to be crap when they showed the earth from space and somehow the clouds was well above the stratosphere. The clouds where so big that you would think that it was on Jupiter.The characters was shallow and you never got to know anyone. There is one scene where they sit around a campfire and talk about their backgrounds but they say like two lines each and that's it! even the characters in Pokemon for game boy was more developed.Then we have the plot. It is the usual America is great and Germany is crap. The Germans as usual are depicted as soulless murderers. They are useless and miss every shot and get moved down by the 100s by 3 guys, sounds familiar? the chest plate on wonder woman even has the American eagle on it... The plot is also full of holes. I can honestly say that i was more lost during the movie then my lectures about Fourier analysis. There was so many whys going through my head that i could easily write down 50; why was the whole fleet after one spy?, why did the Germans stop assaulting the beach?, why did the Germans have the army uniform and not the navy uniform?, why isn't the island full of shipwrecks?, why haven't anyone seen a human before on the island? etc. you get the idea and this is only one scene in the movie!Wonder women herself is overpowered. Makes you wonder why she needs anyone helping her? She is a demigod for crying out loud! Her powers are ridiculous and she is practically unkillable. Whats the fun in that? even superman has an Achilles heel... Her only weakness is being utterly gullible."
2,Did not enjoy,23 June 2017,"Although one can find some hints of ""fighting for/because of god"" (the writing language in the stolen notebook gives a hint of what god is the analogy to), this is mainly a boring movie.I am from Israel, and I like Gal (even voted for her as the woman of the year for some men magazine), but the acting is terrible, and the visual/sound effects are far from special.The high score is definitely misleading."
10,Really Wonder!,4 October 2018,"Awesome story and awesome acting,best movie of 2017!"
8,Best Woman Super Hero Movie,2 October 2018,I enjoy this movie when start to the end this movie make me excite fill love and cry.
10,Wonder Jenkins,23 September 2018,"I love the DC universe and Wonder Woman movie was a revelation for me in superhero movies. Gal Gadot is gorgeous in the image of Diana and Chris Pine in the role of Trevor, also deserves gratitude charming Patty Jenkins who gave us a great story, exciting and instructive story about friendship, peace and love. After each viewing in some moments of the film I couldn't hold back the tears, it is an achievement as actors and Director. Looking forward to the sequel!!!"
2,"OK Acting - Terrible, Tereible Story",22 June 2017,"Lets start with saying there are good parts in the Movie.As a lot of People disliked the first half of the film, i actually liked it. It was a little slow, but overall it set up how wonder woman grew up.Now to the second part: Just.. don't... you cant just change the setting from WW1 to WW2 and only change ""now there are trench wars and its 30 years earlier"".WW1 was the ultimate example of showing people that an industrial war leaves no Winners. But the first thing WonderWoman is doing is choosing a site simply because he is the first person to enter her island and is being chased. After this the movie is playing a perfect black and white game with explanations ""we have stalemate for years, but this small village has still scared villagers that want here to help to fight against the evil forces.At this point i was hoping for a revelation when Wonderwoman kills dozen of German Soldiers that the British would overrun them and kill Germans that are just try to flee and survive, or kill the civilians. That could have been a great revelation to her about all sides of the war are bad, and have perfect character development. BUT no - nothing like this happens, she kills Germans, everything is fine, the villager's greet them as liberators and thank them.Which is actually just an incredible incredible downplay and rewrite of history. The Movie could have made an statement, it could have been anti war. But no it chooses to glorify violence in a black and white setting.But the it gets worse... We enter the finale: After again killing dozens of German solider, Dr. Poision is right in front of her, the one of two truly evil character we have in this movie, and what does WW? she changes her mind not to kill her. After her decision, she goes on to kill again.(but i guess that's okay because it was a woman who was just torturing people and developing weapons of mass destruction instead of soldiers who where forced to fight)Other things that might bother you but i would be willing to let slide because, of - superhero movie: Small Airplane get off in desert and manages to fly way to far Giant ship with canons, vanishes after people in landing rowboats get defeated. secret weapon gets invented and gets used one time with no effect conclusion to sacrifice is just... well senseless Spacetime must be waaaaaay off in to many instances (plane, boat, locations, travel time) Charakter development is hinted but then ignored"
2,Absolute trash.,27 June 2017,"This movie is terrible. Not the worst movie I've seen by DC, that's Suicide Squad, which is why I'm giving a 2 instead of a 1, but still terrible.There are plot holes and stupid decisions galore in this. The titular Wonder Woman is intended to come off as an intelligent but inexperienced, emotional character, but instead comes off as a self-righteous brat who knows only what the plot needs her to know. Her and the rest of the Amazons have a fluent understanding of all languages (with a random assortment of accents) but are apparently willfully ignorant of the cultures, countries, events and inventions of the world.Princess Diana in particular is a holier-than-thou, we need to save everyone character, in the last leg of a war she didn't participate in. She judges everyone as cowardly or inhumane, but doesn't stop to listen what sacrifices had to be made or that suffering had been going on nonstop. She walks out to a battlefield and crosses a deadly No Man's Land with ease, ignoring that soldiers have died there for over a year.It's easy to be judgmental when you're literally a superhero who can do anything, it's degrading to act that way to normal humans who die if they follow. Later she has a ""touching"" minute where the people she saved are killed, before running off and never addressing that point again or learning any lesson.On the point of empty plot points, I suppose her family and friends are all horribly killed by the German destroyer that parked itself by their island, which is never addressed again.The brat character kills Ares, whose entire (forced) backstory is a gross but acceptable deviation away from real mythology, saves the day, ends the war. No real mention or honest tribute to the millions who died to get there, just one mythical brat and her goodwill/badly written love powers for a character who sacrifices himself needlessly.Go save yourself time and watch Sailor Moon. It's got more depth than this movie."
10,The best from Dc,6 October 2018,"I was never expecting less from this movie it was by far the best from DC
It is worth watching"
4,Major Disappointment,10 October 2017,"I can't help but wonder if I watched the same film that impressed so many people. As with most DC Comics films, this one was a great disappointment. While Marvel Comics films tend to be satirical and even self-effacing, DC films are pretentious and tedious. Sadly, Wonder Woman was no exception to this rule.The scripting was totally unimaginative, with dialogue that bordered on infantile. Visually, the landscapes all seemed plastic, with B-movie grade CGI throughout. Even the music was awkward, fighting the dialogue during the more intimate moments and drowning each scene in instrumentals. I found myself doubting whether the director and editor are aware that there doesn't have to be a bombastic or flowery incidental score under everything — it displayed a lack of confidence in the dialogue and acting carrying the scene.Regarding the acting, both Gadot and Pine gave it their best, struggling with the stilted dialogue and boring, telegraphed story line — but even they couldn't transcend this quagmire. If not for its pretentiousness, this film would have played far better as a comedy, lampooning itself. Instead, it drowns itself in incessant platitudes of women good/men bad, framed within a plebian one-dimensional plot.Again, I'm at a loss to explain its high marks, other than to ascribe it to the currently trendy political correctness that elevates all patronizing misandry to high art and entertainment."
9,Best modern DC film,1 October 2018,I finally watched the new Wonder Woman movie. I must say I'm very impressed. This has to be the best DC adaptation they have made in years. The story was interesting and didn't feel cliche at all. The action was all well choreographed and felt very organic. I really love the character interaction in the film as well. The film really brought to heart what Wonder Woman represented for DC Comics. A great ride overall 9 out of 10.
3,Serious Greek Myth Fail,19 June 2017,"This review focuses on Greek Mythology in the Wonder Woman story line, or rather the lack of it. I expect superhero movies to play fast and loose with history and myths. As long as its fun, all is forgiven. Unfortunately, the WW movie didn't rise to this low bar.On the positive side, it was nice to see that the Amazons were placed on a Greek Island, instead of somewhere else on the planet. The island and the training amazons were pretty cool. That's where it stops.We were introduced to a creation myth where the head god, Zeus, created mankind and made them good. What? Zeus didn't create humans. He disliked them, except when he was having sex with them. The titan Prometheus created humans out of clay and Athena, the Goddess of Cities and War (yes, there is more than one war god), breathed life into them. Zeus tortured Prometheus for allowing humans to walk upright and use fire. Neither the gods nor humans were good or bad in the Greek mythos. They simply were.Then Ares (the male god of war) led a rebellion against Zeus. Killing all the other gods. Well, this at least has mythological precedent. The gods under Zeus led a rebellion against the titans and cast them into the underworld. However, Ares seems to have done this all alone.Zeus then created the Amazons to defeat Ares. What? In actual mythology, the tribe of Amazons were the offspring of, wait for it.... Ares and Harmonia - a nymph. So, Ares is WW's father, not brother.Ares then devotes himself to corrupting mankind for the rest of his existence. Odd, in Greek history, the Greeks were so busy waging war they needed two gods to keep up. No corruption necessary.Finally, Zeus, creates a child of his to serve as a weapon against Ares to save mankind, Wonder Women. Really? This sounds odd and forced in a Greek setting. That's because it is. There is another setting where all of this becomes very familiar: the Bible. The Christian God created humans and made them good. His head angel, aka the Devil, rebels against him then devotes his existence to corrupting humans. So, God creates a child of his to help humans resist the corruption, Jesus.Why in the world do we find the bible story as the central plot of a superhero movie? It doesn't make much sense, cheapens the story of the Christ, and obliterates the Greek myths in the process. There are a lot of other issues with this movie, but I have a hard time letting this go."
3,Bad. Really bad.,25 June 2017,"Warning Spoilers!!!!!! I was very dissatisfied with this movie. I did not live up to the hype or the reviews it was getting. Here is why: I thought it was going to be done as realistically as possible other than the fact there was an amazon goddess. Instead what I got was incorrect Greek Mythology. The movie also presented general Ludendorff as the ""main enemy"" when actually after Ludendorff was killed Kaiser was still alive so the war was not over. Kaiser also had no board to consult with to negotiate an armistice because Ludendorff and ""professor poison"" killed them all. As a person who knows about WW1 history I was extremely disappointed. There were also three characters that they tried to implement but were not memorable at all. I can't even remember they're names and I watched the movie half an hour ago. One of them was a sniper who apparently can't shoot! For this point I have to give a little backstory. Professor poison made a mustard gas that substitutes sulfur for hydrogen making gas masks useless. Ludendorff then puts the gas in bombs and the bombs on a plane. There is a moment where all the bombs are exposed while being carted to the plane. It is later revealed that the gas is flammable (well obviously, it's hydrogen!!). So if this sniper guy shot the bombs then they would instantly catch on fire and the death of many (including one of the main characters) could have been avoided."
2,This is NOT what a Female Lead movie should be like,26 June 2017,"I never write reviews on IMDb, but I disagree so much with the 8+ rating I had no choice.The aspect which bothered me the most about this movie, is that it is portrayed as a movie with a strong female lead. I expected Wonder Woman to be this cool warrior, being strong and independent and all that other things strong women should be. But in fact, Wonder Woman was just dragged from location to location by Steve. Every time Wonder Woman showed some fierce or anger, she was being shushed and told to leave (which she did). When Wonder Woman was introduced, the first thing mentioned is how beautiful she is. Further on, where are her muscles???! She is supposed to be a strong warrior, but apparently Hollywoods beauty standards are more important to portray. Another female aspect which was emphasized was her emotional side. In several occasions Wonder Woman portrayed empathy to humans, animals etc. which left her almost crying. The men in her environment told her to let it go (aka don't be such a pussy), while they showed no signs of emotion as the stereotype man. It is like Hollywood had the intention to make a movie with a female lead, but in the process decided that the female should be portrayed as usually is; beautiful, emotionally weak, needs to be controlled.And now I have not even started with all the other aspects which makes this film so bad. Flat characters with very flat lines. Almost every line is some stupid one-liner full of clichés. The makers started off with WWII but halfway through switched to trenches and gas aka WWI? I guess WWII was not interesting enough. Furthermore, the story followed the typical story line build up, no surprises there. And of course more things which did not make sense at all (the gas in the plane would kill everyone in an area of 130km square if grounded, but hey if I fly it 500 meters up and blow it up no problem). The last line of the film and thus conclusion made the whole film silly: only love can save the world... OH come on!"
9,Wander Over To Wonder!,1 June 2017,"It's a brand-new month and you know what that means right? Yes, another super hero movie to kick off the summer blockbuster season. This time it isn't Marvel cranking out the comic book, cinematic feature, but their rivals DC studios. With its recent shaky track record, the DC cinematic universe hasn't gotten the best publicity in terms of quality. So, the studio has decided to get the leading lady herself to pave the way. Yes, today's review is on Wonder Woman starring Gal Gadot and Chris Pine. Can this movie break the bad luck streak of DC/WB studios? Robbie K here to share some opinions on the matter, so let's get started, shall we?LIKES1. Gal Gadot is incredible and steals the show with her poise, pizazz, and acting talents. A fantastic casting direction that really brings the woman to wonder to life in beauty, ferocity, and bouts of heroism (a.k.a. kicking bad guy butt). Acting, stunts, and an on-point delivery of her lines makes this actress one of the tops in my book!2. The action is on point (for most of the movie) filled with impressive displays of weaponry, martial arts, and historical warfare. Wonder Woman's battles held such emotion, managing to bring the suspense all while delivering that feel good, post battle high, you might have gotten from reading a comic book. The team brings some fast-paced thrills we have wanted for almost a year and a half.3. A good representation for girls. I may have already said this, but this movie targets a wide variety of audience members in some form or manner. Yet this reviewer has to give props for the design of a character that is certainly worthy of representing the female super heroes and inspiring the female population that they certainly can do anything. 4. Comedic timing: It's not going to be a super hero movie (at least in this day and age) without some laughs to break up the tension. Wonder Woman continues this trend, filling the void with well-timed one-liners, a few awkward encounters that often deal with sex, and some slap-stick gimmicks that do the job well. 5. Character Development: I know most super hero movies have this element, but there is something about Wonder Woman that stood out to me. This film managed to spin Diana's character development into a roller coaster ride of feelings that almost made me tear up. Her journey to discovering herself and her role into this new world was poetically portrayed, using multiple angles to get the job done. It could have also been due to the powerful soundtrack, the visual effects, or maybe Gadot's acting, but it really worked for me. 6. Fast Pace: We all know those movies that drag (and yes, I'm talking much of DC's library). Not the case for this film. The nearly 150-minute run time flew by for much of the movie having me at one point saying, ""Dang, it's already been 90 minutes."" Not something I often say. DISLIKES:1. Unoriginality: You'll find that Wonder Woman shares a lot with Captain America: First Avenger. The set-up, setting, and build up almost matching outside of the weapon of choice and martial arts moves. Certainly, not the biggest limitation, but something that others have been bothered by. 2. Almost pointless crew: The crew that joins Diana held such promise in the picture, but it was dropped so hard in this movie. Outside of Chris Pine, the other members do little for the overall mission outside of a few throws, some ""tracking"" and mainly comedic relief. There were hints at character development and deeper dynamics, but they fizzled out faster than sparkler at 4th of July. I know, this movie is about Wonder Woman, but why even include these guys if that was the goal. 3. Preachy: Some reviews state the whole feminism/males are pigs is overdone, and to an extent I agree. Yet the bigger dislike was the preachy monologues that sometimes plagued this film. A few times the heat of the moment was lost in a display of self-reflection, which is great, but not in the midst of a battlefield. Some of these moments also had that eye-rolling factor for me. 4. Overuse of CGI: I like special effects, I like stunts, but I don't like overuse of a gimmick. The slow-motion interludes during the action scenes added some cool emphasis to Wonder Woman's skills (alongside some cool finishing moves). Somewhere along the production, someone got a little trigger happy with the effect and used a little too much for me, and soon started disrupting the cool stunts they had Gal do. In addition, there were some special effects that were a bit cheesy and took the edge off of Wonder Woman. Learn from Michael Bay people, too much of special effects makes for many jokes. 5. The ending: Don't turn away, hear me out. The ending is great on many levels (emotional, prowess, role model, and morals). However, it lost the momentum the first few fights had with them, trading suspense for flashy special effects, drawn out banter, and unimpressive choreography. Sort of felt like the ending to X-men apocalypse where the bad guys bark was worse than his bite. The VERDICT:Wonder Woman delivers on many levels and breaks the mediocre displays that DC has cranked out over the last year. It's emotional, it's dynamic, it's fun, and it provides a solid role model for admirable heroes. I feel the movie met most of my expectations and I was happy with the overall product. It's far from perfect though, and still has a few things to tighten up (like developing other characters, balancing the CGI use, and keeping the momentum going). Still, I have to recommend this one for a theater visit, especially you comic lovers out there."
9,The best DCEU movie so far!,25 May 2017,"I'm not so good at reviews, I'm better at just having conversations about movies, but for Wonder Woman, I'll give it a shot.The critics (and not only them) may not like the DCEU so far, but ""Wonder Woman"" is surely the best movie and one of the greatest comic book movies ever.The movie is ""patient"". We get the chance to see in depth Diana's motives and why she ""walked away from mankind"" 100 years ago, and why she returned to protect this world forever.Beautiful landscapes in Themiscyra, a great first act. Then, after Diana leaves her home, we get to see her adjusting in the outside world, and realizing what this war is really about.Every action scene, especially those with her theme song in the background and the combination of darkness and humor are absolutely fascinating, something that makes you wanna have to try really hard to stay in your seat.I liked every performance, but Gal Gadot was the best by far, portraying Diana Prince/Wonder Woman exceptionally. For me, she and Ben Affleck make the best performances of the DCEU and the best portrayals of their characters ever.""Wonder Woman"" made me want to see Justice League even more. Not because I love DC, but because it shows us that we can be optimistic about the DCEU.I may didn't collect my thoughts so well, and this may be a ""bad"" review, but I loved this movie, and I couldn't handle myself. The best is yet to come!9/10"
2,"Over-hyped, far too long and for the majority of its run time plain boring.",18 July 2017,"All those ratings have got to be fake. I can and will not believe that most people ACTUALLY thought this movie was good. It took literally until one hour and 14 minutes, half way through the whole film, to FINALLY get some action sequences that are longer than 5 seconds! Everything beforehand is boring preparation garbage and stupid dialogues by uninteresting, cliché characters nobody cares about mixed with some dad-jokes even immature teenagers would heartily yawn at.The end was also really, really cheesy, completely ""ex machina"" and bad... seriously, who wrote this crap?Compared to other action hero flicks this falls super flat on all fronts: Uninspired story and antagonists, far too little action, too much blabbering and cringey PEGI-13 fillers and jokes.2/10, this movie is utter trash so don't waste your time."
2,boring boring boring,14 June 2017,"This movie goes so very slowly its like watching paint dry.Getting used to the funny accents took a good long while, but i needn't have worried this film gives you over two hours of boredom to get used to the Israeli Amazons accents.Kind of reminded me of the Alexander movie with Colin Farrell .He still had his Irish accent playing a Macedonian so instead of getting him to change it they just made all the other Macedonian characters Irish????Her childish belief that Ares is responsible is repeated so often we just know were being set up for a giant obvious fall when it turns out its just mankind doing what they do best.The action at the end is entertaining but not enough to make up for and hour and a half of completely being bored rigid.This film made me wish id died in world war one so i wouldn't have to watch it."
6,Poor Germans,18 June 2017,"Where to start? I decided to watch this action movie in IMAX 3D, the quality of the movie is so so because most of the battles and action scenes is at night, evening, fog or dark environment (huge minus). Story is really bland and simple and very very predictive - evil Germans and good Englishmen trying to save whole world. The main lady character looks and acts really funny. This wonder move should ends with song from the Shrek ""i'm believer""."
9,Woman Of Steel,10 June 2017,"WONDER WOMAN - I don't know much about Wonder Woman comics. But i know that Superman comics are based on two themes. HOPE and BELIEVE IN HUMANITY. Patty Jenkins as a director took these two themes from Superman and made a Wonder Woman movie or i can say Woman Of Steel.This is basically a FISH OUT OF THE WATER storyline. The movie shows how Wonder Woman deal with the new world about which she don't know much while trying to stop World War 1. This is by far the simplest story of DCEU. Simpler then MAN OF STEEL and DAWN OF JUSTICE. M not counting Suicide Squad because i don't see much of a story in that film. But being simple is not a bad thing. In fact its great as long as origin stories goes. M glade that Themyscira the birth place of WW is given enough time to explore. Which brings me to the cinematography. From Themyscira(which has been shot in South Wales and looked gorgeous) to England to Berlin , everything looked beautiful in this movie. And the 3d is better then THE MUMMY , although i still recommend to watch it in 2d. Jokes were an integral part of the story. All of them are because of the lack of knowledge of WW about the outer world.And these jokes makes the character of WW a little bit of Naive and whole lot sweeter . Some of the jokes also goes little out of the line as long as preferability of Kids goes,I have to say i am very happy with the action sequences of the movie. True that every movie cant achieve the level of Matrix , Man Of Steel and Mad Max , but WW came pretty close. And i liked all of them. Specially the climax one. Which was too close to the climax of Dawn Of Justice , but Patty here injected some serious emotional moments of WW having the self realization , which made the action scene better. Cant go forward without talking about the scores. The whole movie has been ''VIOLINISED''. I know that not exactly a real word but i still used it. And yes the WW theme , came out 3-4 times . And its awesome. Could have been used even more. Gal Gadot is exceptional. On a level that there has been some Oscar talks running around. She well managed the Boldness and Naiveness of the character nicely. And set a benchmark in action scenes for female super heroes. Chris Pinn , called as box office poison(a star who makes flops despite good acting.) is giving here one of his best performance , and yes the movie is working very well at box office and some credit goes to him. What else to say , m happy as well as relieved to see that the movie is good. I was hoping too much from it and it paid of. 8.8/10by ANuP APu KuMaR"
