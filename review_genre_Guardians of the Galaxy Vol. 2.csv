4,Very disappointing,2 May 2017,"I have to start by saying the first film was my favourite film of the last few years and I'm a huge fan.But let's be honest, this was a huuuge let down of a sequel after an amazing first film. The first had a good story, fleshed out characters, believable villains, genuine affection, drama, tension and a soundtrack that was original and used brilliantly.This film had a weak, bloated story. Almost every scene filled with forced, cheap gags. Unbelievable and disappointing bad guys who tried to wise crack their through and lost any menace. Acting was poor apart from Yondu and Nebula who was woefully underused.This was was like a comedy parody of the first film. A goofy, TV sequel that had none of the magic of the original blockbuster.At one point Drax wisecracks that he does big turds. I'd venture none as big as this one.Avoid"
8,Guardians' date with the creator.,13 October 2017,"The first film was the most unexpected. That was one of the most colourfull space films I have ever seen. Youthful, energetic, fantastic visuals and so the same followed in this sequel as well. Not the same good, but stood to the expectation of the first film's success. This story does not have a great adventure in the galaxy. A simple quest, but a thrilling action-adventure. Now this accidental space gang is set to meet the creator.It's time for Peter to meet his father, Ego. As he still upset with his mother's death, his encounter with his father was not as expectedly smooth. On the other side of the story, Rocket, Yandu, Baby Groot make their escape from the captivity. They all end up on the Ego's planet where the rest of the film going to take place. Being the guardians of the galaxy, their fight against the whoever threaten the safety of the universe once again tested with their strength as a team.James Gunn did it again. And I'm confident that he's going to do the same for next as well. All the actors were fantastic like the previous film. This time, little fun with little Groot. Anybody who loved the first would love it too. Being a franchise from Marvel universe, it is yet to join the 'Avengers'. So far so good. I'm now expecting one of the best of best trilogies. Bring it on the volume 3.8/10"
5,Must disengage brain entirely to enjoy,28 May 2017,"With so much talent in this film, it's so disappointing that the writers were right . Don't waste a dime on developing a sensible plot because the hordes of fans will eat this crap up like it was a 5 star meal. Hence the 8.1 star rating which reflects a demographic with time on their hands and a studio with plenty of marketing budget.On the bright side - the CGI is great. The sets are beautiful. There are some very funny moments. The cast still has some chemistry with each other. And I've seen movies that were much worse and unwatchable than this one. But I wouldn't be honest if I didn't give this a very generous 5 because of the horrendous, deficient plot. And after this film I'd have to say that I've about had enough with this series. We've heard the story, had some fun with the characters and it's clear that what was fun, fresh and original is what it should have been - a one film wonder leaving Hollywood to develop another story. Without giving away the big reveal or true spoilers, I'll explain the problem that are evident throughout the entire film:(1) Repeated jokes as if we're supposed to be warmed to it, e.g. how dumb and oblivious baby Groot is (except when he needs not to be.) Funny at the opening moment and gets more difficult to stomach as we make our way through.(2) The fact that our heroes are never really in danger. They are always somehow able to avoid dangers of the most extreme kind for prolonged periods while they joke during the encounter and then you know they will be saved by some unknown force to be named shortly.(3) The abject stupidity of supremely smart characters. Because we need those whose level of intelligence is off the charts to continue to do some really stupid or missing the obvious for a prolonged period of time but just enough for our heroes to have the time to do something to save themselves and the galaxy from certain destruction.(4) The explanation of the villain's plan made absolutely no sense. It was the usual pseudo-brilliant but amorphous hogwash that only made sense when you were 5 years old in the world of make believe without having to think about whether there was any logic.(5) Occasional product placement. Fedex anyone? It's one thing to have a ""special moment"" and another to believe we're too stupid to understand why it happened. And then there is Baby Groot who exists and will continue to exist solely for merchandising... Too cute to kill off. ;)"
8,Great sequel overall,20 August 2017,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a great movie, and I would say better than the recent superhero movies. I'm afraid thought that the first movie set the expectations so high that is not crazy to doubt if this one was able to keep up.Visually is as good as the first one, the acting is on point and the soundtrack is dope. The plot is fine, although it falls under the ""knowing better the characters and realizing their sad and deep feelings"" cliché. It leaves me with the feeling that the first one was innovative and fresh, wherever this one just reused the formula.Apart from that, this is an entertaining and fun movie, and I would recommend it to anyone who is into superhero or science fiction movies. It doesn't disappoint."
7,Almost as funny and charming as the first,24 April 2017,"As someone who was floored by the first film, I was eager to see how the second installment in Gunn's trilogy(yes, it's a trilogy now) would pan out. To be honest, I was a bit anxious, as we are familiar with Hollywoods track record when it comes to sequels. However there are rare moments when the sequel lives up to it's predecessor. As is the case here, as Gunn delivers the same charm, humor and emotion as the first film. The big difference is the focus on Peter's story, As our heroin meets his long lost father Ego(brilliantly played by Kurt Russell), who shows up at the knick of time, as Rocket pisses off Ayesha(Elizabeth Debicki) who sends a space armada after them. To add the cherry on top of this pie is the soundtrack(Sam Cooke's Bring it on Home to Me), that was meticulously chosen. If you were a fan of the first, don't doubt, Gunn delivers a space opera that lives up to it's hype. I have high hopes for the future of the MCU, it's clear that the studio let Gunn's creativity speak for itself and boy did he have a lot to say."
4,Here's how not to do a sequel,7 August 2017,"OMG, what a terrible sequel to one of the best movies of the decade...Shallow, unfunny, clichéd, predictable and often pathetic, in many places poorly acted and directed, with overabundance of cheesy fake-looking rainbow effects.It's like writers read all viewer comments to Vol.1 then added whatever people liked 100 times over into Vol.2. So the lovely 80s music vignette now becomes massive bore shoveled into every scene, complex Yondu-Peter relationship gets butchered into cheesy pathos, Yondu's character gets reduced to repeating Vol.1 whistling scene over and over, Rocket goes boring with highlights being Vol.1 repeats, Gamora/Nebula relation - again repeats, Groot no development at all beyond Vol.1 ending cute cgi.The only character that actually gets improved is Drax, his lines are written and get delivered in the best manner of the first movie, unfortunately that can't keep this wreck afloat."
9,The Sequel to Those Unusual Marvel Superhero in the Galaxy,27 April 2017,"This movie was a very fun superhero film. It did not provide us with very heavy storyline, the premise was quite simple and best of it all, it was having lots and lots of funny moments. My wife and I truly enjoyed this movie as we had laughs all over the movie and there were even some emotional moments as well which was very lovely to see at the end (and made my wife very emotional). I love the chemistry among the Guardians, and I loved Baby Groot's very cute and adorable behavior. I also loved the opening scene which I think was very cool.In addition to the good chemistry among the stars, I also felt that Mantis' character was fun to see, especially whenever she was interacting with Drax. In this sequel, it was also surprising to see Drax' very funny characterization and his comments. Both Yondu and Nebula also had larger important role in this movie compared to Volume 1. There was even a surprise new character played by Sylvester Stallone whom I understand would be having larger role in future Marvel movies.Apart from those fun interactions and the nice light story, the movie itself was not the type of full of action scenes. Mostly it was done in the early stage, middle part and the ending part. The sound effects were good, the effects involving Baby Groot and Rocket were awesome, but I felt the CGI effects were not that nice, especially during the scenes in the Ego planet where it really looked computerized. However, it was not really a bothering scene. One thing that was quite curious for me is the trailer to this movie was already showing Kurt Russel portraying Peter's father, which I thought would be best kept hidden to avoid spoiler. But then as we continued watching it, I realized that it was more like a part that was supposed to intrigue us.I personally felt that this movie was better than Volume 1, in term of the story and characterizations. And for those of you who knew that Marvel's movies would have some end credit scenes, better wait till the very end, since this film had got not 1, not 2 not even 3, but 5 post credit scenes altogether.So if you enjoyed the first volume, you would enjoy this one even better. I would recommend you to watch the first one before seeing this one to have a better understanding on the movie. Though I am pretty sure that most likely you would have seen it. Now if you are a fan of a much heavier superhero movie, than this one may not suit your thirst, but I am confident that you would still be entertained watching this one."
1,A flashy production with no substance,1 May 2017,"At the time of writing, there are only 7 out of 120 user reviewers that did not like the movie. I know I will receive a multitude of unhelpful votes for voicing my honest feedback about this movie. However, I hope that my feedback will be helpful for people who are able to judge a film in an objective manner so that they, at least, will be able to save their hard earned cash.Firstly, the main antagonist is a Marvel character that has been completely changed for this movie. It bears no background similarity to the character in the comics whatsoever. I understand that the Marvel movies are all about making a spin on the comic book story arcs, but this difference was far too large for me to accept.Whilst watching the movie, I had to ponder whether I had stepped into a Marvel Superhero version of ""Fast and Furious"". There was a continuous message that family is important and how the protagonists became who they were due to disenfranchised childhoods. Whilst this is a valid point, I do not feel that it belongs in a superhero action movie as it serves no purpose. Worse was when the message contradicted itself when we see Peter Quill betrayed by his Father. The clumsiness of this contradiction did nothing to alleviate the sickly sweet message that the movie was trying to convey. I get that James Gunn is trying to send out a message to the younger generation but I would think that kids go to watch a superhero movie for the action, and will not really appreciate or acknowledge the message that he is driving.Unlike the first movie, there was a distinct lack of character focus and their abilities. It could easily have been an action movie without superheroes. In fact, the movie seemed to be focused on two characters when it came to showcasing their abilities. One of these had a sequence that was inspired by the Quicksilver scenes in the X-Men movies. The other was extremely underwhelming and was defeated far too incredibly when you consider the differences in age and experiences. None of the characters were interesting with the exception of Nebula and Mantis. However, Pom Klementieff played her role like a stuttering female cyborg that I even thought the role was played by an East Asian actress before I checked the cast members. The actors paid to play the new characters were miscast in my opinion. Sylvester Stallone's performance reminded me of his Judge Dredd and not in a good way.It was clear that the popular factors in the first movie were taken and overdone in the second movie. Drax was made to look like a dumb fool once again but even more than in the first movie. While the CGI effects were good, the cuteness factor of Baby Groot served only to market the movie to kids and geek girls, and to rake in merchandise profit. There was also constant mention and focus on the cassette mix which was totally unnecessary (again, for merchandise promotion).With the exception of Captain America and the first two Avengers and Thor movies, why do the Marvel movies have to be over-saturated with humor? It's one thing to market the movies to a wider audience but it's totally another thing when it's taken too far, and the humor becomes so clichéd."
1,Disappointing.... this movie cares more about jokes than a good plot,5 May 2017,"***Potential Spoilers***+Visuals were okay but not that great at some point it kinda looked animated +Acting was perfect -but the plot was Horrible -Some of the comedy sequences felt Forced-Villian was underwhelming -Overacting -Pacing issuesMarvel overused their formula in this one & it just felt Choppy & bloated there are jokes but by jokes i mean there are too many if you are fan of Forced ripoff jokes then this movie is for you there wasn't even much action You have a guy name Drax the Destroyer but you given him only one Action sequence Come'on **Spoilers* Nebula tries to kills herself to kill Gamora, and later on both of them forgive each other ? It just felt messy The only thing i learned from GOTG 2 is that never go with high expectation while seeing a movie"
8,Top-Notch Entertainment !,4 May 2017,"*SPOILER FREE REVIEW*As a huge fan of the first film, I went to watch the movie as soon as it came out. And I have to say I wasn't disappointed at all.Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol.2 Offers so much thrills and an awesome cinematic experience, The action starts right from the opening scene and it doesn't end until the last 2 seconds of the film. The people behind the movie just knew how to not make the audience bored, and they succeeded at that.I have to say that 3D ticket here is worth the additional price, because honestly, if any movie deserved to be really watched in 3D it's this one,It adds so much depth to the scenes and makes the movie alive.The plot is interesting enough to keep you engaged and the pacing never really drags even with the movie's long duration.The soundtrack just fits right into its place and it really helped the background quality, providing the best classic songs. The movie is also really humorous and I found it as funny as the first.Due to the movie's high budget, the scenery is Amazing! The movie feels like a very entertaining roller coaster, it was a joy and all the crowd were very pleased.In the end, Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol.2 Is a MUST-SEE for fans of the first one and a VERY ENJOYABLE ride for everyone else. It's simply one of these movies that are always fun to watch."
2,Expensive garbage,8 August 2017,"Where do I even begin? Oh my... this script could have easily been written by a 10-year-old, practically every move and line of dialogue were predictable, clichéd, and downright cringy most of the time. I cannot, for the life of me, understand why this 'movie' gets any form of praise for the 'acting' that took place in this movie. The aforementioned acting was weak, not only did the story lack substance, but practically every interaction is inevitably guided towards infantile, unintelligent humor. The CGI/Animation were not up to the standard that we are accustomed to from Marvel, it was just flashy and all over the place. I usually try not to write any negative reviews, but this was just too much to handle. I am a big fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and I was in awe as to how awful this movie was. Marvel movies have silly humor here and there but a good portion of the jokes are well placed in their movies, they can even be intelligent and memorable; but this... whatever this was... horrendous writing. If you are like me, and want to be up-to-date with what's happening in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and that's why you chose to watch this movie, you didn't miss out on anything."
7,"a great, entertaining sequel to a great movie",7 June 2017,"I had my doubts about this one while going to the cinema, because I am a big fan of the first one and was genuinely worried that this one wouldn't live up to it's predecessor. While I do believe that the first one was a better movie, this one is what I would consider a perfect sequel. Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2 does the right thing by letting us get to know the characters a bit better. What I was most surprised by, however, was the choice to focus more on the character of Yondu than that of Chris Pratt's Star Lord. I thought it was a brilliant choice; Michael Rooker really shines in this role and is by far the best character in the movie. There are also some really cool action scenes with his arrow. Star Lord gets thrown to the side a bit, which is good since we already know pretty much everything about him except for who his dad is, which we do find out in this movie. All in all, the action was fun, the characters were great, the colors were great, it was much funnier than the first one (this movie is very much a comedy with some absolutely hilarious one-liners, mostly from Drax) and just overall a delightful experience. It definitely exceeded my expectations. That being said, I do have just a few problems with this movie. They don't ruin the movie for me and they're not that bothersome, but still. We all know about the recent trend in big superhero movies such as this one, which is bad villains. And, honestly, all of my problems start with the villains. The Guardians are being followed throughout the movie by these golden people, which ultimately serve no purpose in the movie other than being ""villains"", I guess. I say ""villains"" because it's very much debatable what their motivations are and even who they are, and we just don't know enough about them to care. Everything they do is pretty ridiculous and over the top. The other problem I have is with Kurt Russel's character. Now, I love Kurt Russel and I was excited to see him play Peter Quill's dad, but his character just feels like a big exposition machine and, not to get too spoilery, goes the typical cliché route. His motivations are clear, but very much overused and he's basically in the movie as a plot device. These two things, though, aren't that big of a problem to me because they were just devices for the movie to give Star Lord something to do (of course, a movie needs conflict), and they were background things working around the jokes, fun, and the adventure the characters we love were on. And the ending does get quite emotional.Ultimately, I think fans of the first movie will have no problems enjoying this one as well and I believe it has done everything right as a sequel. Let's just hope Marvel continues down this path of movies that know what they are and are just plain fun."
8,The Guardians Strike Back,24 April 2017,"I was lucky enough to see this on 20/4 at an industry screening which allowed me to sit on the film for a few days before I gave a review. I can safely say GotG Volume 2 absolutely wowed me. I can't believe these bunch of lovable misfit a-holes made one of the most MATURE themed films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film is visually gorgeous. The use of colour, design and the straight up imagination of the source material outstand any MCU film prior. The action is glorious and astonishing. One scene in particular, I was jaw-dropped in its entirety as direction, action-choreography and music all came together so harmoniously. And THE MUSIC! What an eargasmic soundtrack. The songs are more poetic this time around and fit the subtext of the film perfectly. The trailers gave me the feel of the first movie; a straight-up Sci-fi action-comedy with a simple point A to B plot. GotGV2 is so much MORE than this! This film is patient with its characters and there is an emphasis on growth and family. It manages to balance 7-8 characters and gives almost all of them a satisfactory emotional arc. There is so much to chew on here with the issues and motifs felt by certain characters and I applaud that! This film is vastly different and I'm glad because I just love these characters so much! They are still so fun and energetic. It's great to see the team again and how their dynamic transforms. Also I forget to mention, the film is laugh-out-loud funny! All thanks to Drax who is by far the most comedic character and put me stitches.Overall, this was both (I can't believe I'm saying this about the Guardians of the Galaxy) an emotionally dense and exciting blast. If Guardians 1 is the fast-paced Sci-Fi adventure like Star Wars was in 1977, then Vol. 2 is the deeper & richer film that takes its time to expand our beloved characters; just like Empire Strikes Back."
10,Laugh out loud funny movie filled with many touching moments that will make you cry!,7 May 2017,"Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 is such a glorious celebration of all that's enjoyable about going to the movies. It makes you feel you've gotten your money's worth, from the ticket price to all the expensive food and drink items. Everyone in the theater walked out chatting and laughing about the movie. I can't think of a way to make a more enjoyable movie than GOTG 2.From the beginning, the MARVEL STUDIOS logo has changed. While it's slowly creeping on screen, we used to see comic pages flipping. That's now replaced with movie footage, and the music is now epic, making the MS logo feel more classy and majestic.The opening credits scene is just so creative, and a scene like that could very well be one of the best ending scenes in another movie. But in GOTG 2, it's just the opening! Looking back on the entire film, I can't believe in this age where we're all so used to seeing flashy space and combat action scenes, everything gets better and better as this movie rolls along towards the ending.This is a really character-driven movie, and every single main actor gets fantastic screen time. No one is in the background. They all shine. Jokes are non-stop, and there are WAY more jokes in this sequel. Some of the humor is so unexpected and wacky that you'll just burst out loud laughing! You'll hear other people in the theater continue to laugh as the movie rolls on and you'll laugh again just thinking about what happened on screen.As funny as this movie gets, you'll be pleasantly blindsided with some extremely heartwarming scenes between characters. How can a movie make people laugh so hard, then the next minute have everyone sobbing, or at least fighting back tears? If you're the type of movie-goer who likes to brag that you didn't cry through an emotional scene, prepare to get tested. GOTG 2 has many emotional scenes, and they happen at the weirdest, most unexpected times. My bet is, you WILL cry at least once. There's just too many good scenes coming at you and you'll stumble. This movie is such a rare roller-coaster of emotional ups and downs. Enjoy the ride! The end credits are filled with things to keep you sitting in your chair. Don't make the mistake of walking out. There are something like 5 or 6 end scenes dispersed through the credits. You'll see people in the theater standing to leave, then sitting. Standing again, then sitting down. There's just so much going on in the end credits!From start to finish, this movie has everything and the kitchen sink thrown in. It's all bigger, better, funnier and way more emotional than the first GOTG, and easily the most entertaining thing you might witness this year in the theater. Don't miss this movie!"
3,So disappointed,26 May 2017,"I watched the first movie I believe at least 50 times, one of my favourite movie since the last 10 years; however this Vol. 2 really disappointed me. I think it's a goofy movie for kids, a bit different from the first one. The ""funny"" scenes have been dramatized too much, so much that they became stupid jokes. The movie itself is too long, no funny movie should ever be so long. You cannot keep people laughing for more than 2 hours...even if the movie was a REALLY funny movie (which it was not). I was expecting coming out this Vol. 2 for so long...I guess I created too many expectations for it. Go to watch the movie thinking that would be ""just OK"", my 2 cents."
10,Open Mindedly Exploring the Chauvinistic Celestial Domain,8 May 2017,"This story has a philosophically intriguing and imaginative theme. If a person lived forever and for millions of years, what would be his psychology. What if he is also able to manifest his physical body and his world through his thoughts. This movie presents a picture where this person becomes extremely egoistic. There is no 'she' to this 'him' and I think that's what went wrong with this guy.He creates a wonderful planet and then to get rid of his loneliness goes around looking for other life in the universe. He finds many women, makes love to them and plants his seed on every planet he went so that he could take over the universe. He is able to destroy other beings and planets. This makes him think he could just destroy them whenever he wanted and walk away from the crime scene. But his son proves him wrong.Although it is nowhere close, this story does remind of god the father and Jesus the son and another story where it all went biblical. So the son in the story realizes who is father is, and who his real daddy is, and the difference between the two.Another interesting aspect of the story was the relationship between two sisters. Gamora and Nebula who were brought up by an abusive parent. Gamora remained beautiful because of her sister's sacrifices. I like the part where Gamora realizes this fact and starts appreciating her sister. Nebula was at the verge of killing her sister because she felt she had had enough. Love renders us weak and sacrifice has its limits. But in the end honest communication works its magic. The importance of role of communication in personal relationships comes to forefront altogether.There are many other intriguing things like Yondu looking into Rocket's eyes and saying a magical phrase. Totally amazing movie. A must watch."
10,"So Good, Just Pure and Simple Pleasure",8 May 2017,"The intro was one of the best I've seen in a movie for a long time, Mixture of Groot dancing to ELO's Mr Blue Skies while the rest fight in the background is pure mind blowing Joy. So many LOL moments, the cinema crowd were in stitches, I have to go see this again, I won't meander on too long but this for me was on par and up there for the first movie. That's tough thing to pull off these days as the firstwas mind blowing as I don't think anyone expected it to be so good again I was expecting this to be great but not as good but I was wrong. Part of me was hoping for another tentative link towards Infinity Wars but a minor niggle on my part. Great Movie Great Characters Great Laughs"
9,Great Adventure,5 June 2017,"My main criticism was that I don't feel like you needed to have seen the previous movie to really get/enjoy this one. You would have missed out on the bonding of the team and the backstory of Nebula and Gamora, but overall you'd be fine. Overall, though it was a great movie, it felt more like a side story in the many adventures of the Guardians of the Galaxy and less like an actual continuation of their main story. Why? Well, we did have that wonderful cameo of great actors who portrayed the original Guardians. We had our Stan Lee cameo. And, we had Peter Quill's backstory explained. Other then that, I don't yet see how any of this advanced the main plot of Thanos or of any big threat to the Galaxy. My favorite parts of the movie were Rocket and Yondu's character growth. I felt tears in my eyes when Yondu died. Such a powerful message that parentage and parents can be such distinct things. Also, Gamora and Nebula's sister bonding and reconciliation. Their scenes were so much of what it is to be a sister. One cannot hate in such a way without there being love in the mix.The only truly plot advancing potential that I saw in this movie were the after-credit scenes. Especially the one with Adam. Only time will tell if any more of this will have an effect on the Marvel Universe. Regardless, this was a great story to tell."
1,Meh... Fast and Furious in Space. *FAMILY*,4 May 2017,"What's Hollywood's obsession with family these days? Wonder if it has to do the the growing culture of nepotism elsewhere. Regardless, a script cannot rely on simply yelling ""FAMILY"" as the motivation for EVERYTHING. And this movie works that cliché to DEATH. *LITERALLY*Not worth a 1/10, more like a 6 plus (which I'll adjust when they stop manipulating the ratings. Forgettable at best, and you know the story is crap when all you can remember is CGI baby Groot. Suffers terribly from Bond villain syndrome, in that villains needs too much exposition (AKA weird and unexplained motivations).Actual line in the movie, after one character tries to murder another, ""You needed to win, I just wanted a *RELATIVE*."" *slow claps* that TOTALLY explains attempted murder. Did I mention there's attempted genocide too?! For reasons that only Gunn will know."
10,This movie is a joyous experience. Guaranteed to raise your mood!,8 May 2017,"James Gunn is clearly a fan of the work, and his love for the material shows through out the movie. Such a weird and bizarre universe so beautifully adapted to the screen.This time around, part2 concentrates more on character development rather than being a plot driven movie. It concentrates on building the team dynamics and their relationships with each other. This enriches the movie's universe and is a decision with long term considerations for the series. Even if you miss out on the amount of plot, you will be easily distracted by the great humor. The jokes are well written through out the running time. I haven't had so many laughs in a movie since Deadpool.The plot is well written and the extra character development time raises the stakes and our attachment to the characters during action scenes. The actions scenes are visually incredible, in fact the entire universe is colorful and beautiful to behold.I had a blast watching this movie, and I think you will too."
8,Family cosmagogue,5 June 2018,"Today I dedicated to the Guardians of the Galaxy. I remembered the contents of the first film and got acquainted with the second part, which placed a great emphasis on the drama of characters and family values. With this text, I will try to orient you to watching this movie, because despite the fact that the film, though done by the templates of the first part, even stylistically and graphically turns out to be the ideological continuer of the first film. James Gunn stayed at the role of the project to revive the popularity of forgotten heroes, which by two thousand and fourteen already no one remembered. The second series promised to be bigger in many ways, but could it? Let's understand!Guardians of the galaxy angered the sovereignty of the Sovereign, their heads are hunted by space pirates, the ship is broken, and the team nearly cried to death. But there is no evil without good: The Star Lord met a long-lost father named Ego and learned the story of his origin. Because of which the Guardians again have to save this galaxy ... Synopsis is good, catching and logically coming out of the first film. The main question disturbing many: the second part was better or worse than the original. And here already from which side to look.""Guardians 2"" are made at the same high level as the first part. They are as spectacular and funny and, perhaps, even more ambitious and touching. There is everything that should be in the film about the Guardians: a lot of humor, space battles, dizzying action scenes and music from the seventies. And, of course, Stan Lee's cameo and Howard's ducks.But what's in the continuation there, so this is at least something fundamentally new, at least some serious differences from the original. ""Guardians 2"" is not a sequel like ""Terminator 2"" or ""Aliens"", raising the series to a new level, but just another portion of adventure in a familiar style. It can be compared with the next episode of the series, which is no better and no worse than the previous one. And he loses only because he is not the first.
Still, the first ""Guardians of the galaxy"" was a terrific surprise. Nobody knew what to expect from the film about little-known heroes from the comic books Marvel. Nobody expected that a talking raccoon and not quite speaking tree would become symbols of 2014. And what to expect from the second ""Sentinels"", everyone knew, and this is what they give: ""Pirates of the Caribbean Space."" Parallels between the two Disney franchises and the truth is a lot. Space pirates behave exactly like the team of the ""Black Pearl"", and the Raccoon raccoon with its antics makes us remember Jack Sparrow. Well, Peter Quill reminds Will Turner, who finally found his lost father. And absolutely not how I expected.James Gunn did not deceive, saying that the main theme in the film would be the theme of the family. She touched not only Peter, but also each of the Guardians. Gamora finds out the relationship with her sister Nebula and serves as a caring ""mommy"" for dunces-muzhiks. The rocket (do not call it raccoon!) Actually becomes a father for Little Grunt. Even Drax the Destroyer, which in the first film seemed almost superfluous, was revealed due to the fact that he found himself a pair. He flirts in a friendly way with the fragile empathic Mantis, and their joint scenes have come out touchingly awkward and comical.Characters and parallel lines in the sequel became more. To the cast was added Kurt Russell and Sylvester Stallone (and David Hasselhoff flashed into the cameo). The composition of the Guardians themselves grows, and they will look more than the Avengers. It is felt that it is harder for Gann to come up with memorable remarks for everyone and from time to time he gives slack. This is especially noticeable in jokes: sometimes they roll down to humor below the belt, and not an adult, as in ""Deadpool"", but some school. When a raccoon threatens to throw a fecal to a friend, when the great Kurt Russell has to joke about his huge penis, it does not cause laughter, but awkwardness. Such moments can spoil the impression from the first half of the film.
t is better where the director succeeds in the scenes, where humor is born from the action itself. As an example, any scene dedicated to Little Gruda is suitable. He does not say much, but everything he does, whether it's trying to get friends out of captivity, dancing during a battle or careless handling of a bomb, turns out touching and hilarious. If the slogan of the first part was ""Especially the raccoon"", then the second would come up with the slogan ""Especially Little Grut"".In ""Guardians 2"" there is already no magic spark of novelty, which caused such enthusiasm in the first part. But this is a competent and qualitative continuation. The scale has grown, the characters are better exposed, and jokes and memorable scenes would be enough for a few more films.Verdicting: The movie turned out to be excellent, it has a smart picture, intelligent thoughts (the dialogue between Drax and Mantis about love of freaks and beautiful ones was remembered) and moments of non-stop dynamics with colorful explosions and blasters, in the best traditions of the new ""Star Trek"". Of the merits: Yonda, Drax and Little Groot are well exposed, they really experience for them throughout the whole film, enchanting spectacle and jokes above the belt that have a place to be. From not very successful: jokes below the belt, ill-conceived villain and lack of novelty, but about the last point you forget completely, because you are immersed in the cinema with your head, because it tightens. I advise you to watch two films at once - the picture is more complete. All good and pleasant viewing!"
3,Guardians of the what?,8 July 2017,"The most astonishing thing about this movie to me is how fast I forgot the entire experience.I kinda remember that cool opening scene with Groot - but after that? Guardians of the Galaxy 2 moves from one action scene to the next with a bunch of random banter about an extended family... which is completely contradicted in the final 15 minutes.I also remember a bunch of absurd happenings during the action scenes. Improbable results, luck, weird environments that do not follow any known physics and characters screaming at one another over the ambient sound.To paraphrase someones wisdom - the script wasn't the result of time, hard work, skill and craftsmanship. Things happen on the screen because the screen writers say so. This is what many superhero films have become: glorified CG cartoons that feel like really long TV episodes.Ironic too - in an age of great TV writing, many blockbuster movies have been reduced to mass world wide appeal instead of any unique writer/director vision.I really didn't like this movie 3/10"
10,I call it Side B,2 May 2017,"It's not often you wanted to hear side B of a tape. Unless you were too lazy to rewind it. I'm not sure how they did it but side B aka Vol. 2 is a greatest hits album. It went double Vibranuim. The cast stays in complete character only improving by letting the audience get to know and love them. Even Drax's absurd laugh was necessary. They did not drag you through the beef between sisters, x gang affiliates or father and son. They only produced an appropriate outcome for each situation that leaves the studio wide open for Vol. 3. The soundtrack is really its own character making even the most rhythmically challenged viewers feeling comfortable bobbing their heads. I don't watch trailers so hearing a familiar voice in a film that already had it all was the bonus track with features artist."
10,As expected for marvel studios,28 April 2017,Yeah marvel did it again and hit us with an Amazing Movie I as a comics and MCU fan Really enjoyed the movie it has some astonishing easter eggs that will make you stand from your chair in the theater.... the movie got a great action scenes (like any marvel movie) a good Scenario and beautiful Directing from James Gunn he really did a great job with this movie. the CGI are quit good as expected from a marvel movie... but what i liked the most of this movie is character development this movie is completely about develop the characters that we met in the first Guardians movie you really start to care more about the characters especially Yondu he become my favourite character in the Guardians they really work him well very well ! and we can't forget the humor it does take a big part of the movie this movie was the funnies MCU movie till now... is it good as the first ? well the first movie was a surprise hit not like vol2 cause we expected the movie to be great ... and also Thanos scene in the first *_*
8,Magnificent Sequel,13 August 2017,"The Guardians of the Galaxy are hired by the leader of the well-planned Sovereign race Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki) to destroy a monster to protect their valuable batteries. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket and Baby Groot defeat the monster and receive the notorious Nebula (Karen Gillan), who is Gamora estranged sister, as previously agreed to receive the bounty offered for her. However Rocket steals a couple of batteries and their spacecraft is attacked by the Ayesha and Sovereign. Out of the blue, the Sovereign fleet is destroyed by a mysterious ship and the Guardians crash on a planet. Soon they learn that the ship that helped them is owned by Ego (Kurt Russell), who claims to be Quill's father and invites Quill to visit his planet.

""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" is a magnificent sequel, with a full of action story and top-notch CGI. The witty humor associated to charismatic characters and cameo of famous actors make ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" a wonderful entertaining film. There are several scenes in the credit; therefore the viewer musts wait until the very end. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Guardiões da Galáxia Vol. 2"" (""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"")"

10,Guardians is back and has plenty of visuals and action. A great second chapter in GotG.,6 May 2017,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is back and flashy as ever when it comes to its visual style of action, soundtrack, a fun cast, and the laughable humor. Usually sequels can be a let down after its predecessor set the standards high. And the build up momentum for the sequels is easily forgotten. Writer/Director James Gunn manages to continue what worked on the first movie and expand further with the characters he brought together. Yes, it is a ragtag of misfits that try to be a team and argue to each other with their own personal issues. In the end, they see each other not as friends but family. The plot follows Peter (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), and Baby Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) are tasked at fighting away a giant monster and protecting valuable batteries. Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki) the leader of the sovereign race, who needed the guardians help for the task. After a dispute, leaving the guardians on the run away from Ayesha and her army of drones chasing them away. The guardians crash on a planet, where they come across Ego (Kurt Russell) who is Peter's father. Ego takes Peter, Gamora, and Drax to his planet. Meanwhile, Rocket, Groot, and Nebula (Karen Gillan) stay behind their wrecked ship, only to come across the Ravagers led by Yondu (Michael Rooker). Trying to claim the bounty on the guardians that is set by Ayesha. Guardians of the Galaxy 2 has everything you can expect. It has plenty of action and the visual effects were colorful, and impressive. When Peter and his team visit Ego's planet. The visual effects were astonishing. The set pieces were great too. It does have its fun share of humor. It is fun to see a dysfunctional team trying to get along; you have Peter and Rocket with their arrogant cocky self. Nebula and Gamora personal conflict that keeps them fighting each other. The one thing that always drives Peter and his team is how they see each other as family. Also, there is baby groot which is always a scene stealer. Groot is small and cute, even from the opening moment of him dancing and needing music playing as the guardians are fighting against a giant monster. The villains are usually what worry me, as several Marvel movies later. They all have that same motive and have that cliché routine. I was worried for a second in this film about who and what the villain was. Without giving away spoilers or details. This film villain is by far better compared to the first movie. Definitely, the villain does not show until later. It definitely leads the direction into a big climax with the guardians trying to save the galaxy yet again. The guardians are tested personally as Peter, Gamora, and Drax are separated from Groot and Rocket being with Yondu. Gunn never lets a single moment become dull. There are easter eggs, celebrity cameos, etc. Also, there are five mid/post credit scenes that are worth checking out unlike the first movie end scene of Howard the Duck that was a waste. Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a visually exciting sequel that surpasses the original. It has a fun cast and characters, the soundtrack is awesome, the visual effects and action is exciting, the villain is an interesting one, and James Gunn's fun direction makes it a flashy fun movie."
10,The One There By Your Side,8 May 2017,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" is less smart ass than the original and all heart. ""Guardians 2"" is all about family. ""Vol. 2"" is the movie rarity—the sequel greater than the original. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" retains its whimsical irreverence and funnier than thou swag with stunning visuals. From the opening sequence the Guardians hilariously thrash and get thrashed by a galactic serpent on some distant planet. Their mission is to recover some invaluable unpronounceable energy batteries for the elitist Sovereign race. Director and Writer James Gunn establishes the veiled narrative thread, and the movie is warp speed ahead.Incredible action and wisecracks aside what creates ""Guardians 2"" as special is family. I was moved and inspired as Chris Pratt's Peter confesses, ""Sometimes, the thing you've been looking for your whole life is right there beside you all along."" From the first ""Guardians"" we recall the deadly rivalry of the sisters Gamora, played by strong nurturing Zoe Saldana, and Nebula, played by suffering and poignant Karen Gillan. After fighting nearly to the death, Nebula cries to her sister, ""You're the one who wanted to win! I wanted a sister!"" Saldana and Gillan are amazing. ""Guardians 2"" fiercely dares to touch your heart.Chris Pratt impressively chiseled his body to play Peter Quill. He admirably helms the action star mantle. He makes ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" greater as a whole. He does charming smart ass whether he is clumsily romancing beautiful Saldana's Gamora or delivering throwaway on-liners. Pratt's humanity distinguishes him as a true star. Peter discovers his father Ego, played by charismatic Kurt Russell. Ego is the Celestial-- literally a god, who left Peter's dying Mother. Peter asks his Father if she was the love of his life, why he left her. Peter says, ""I had to watch her die!"" Michael Rooker's Ravager thief Yondu was the one who raised Peter in Ego's absence. All is not what it seems. Rooker's nobility and compassion resonates the profound conflict of Peter's Fathers. Ego tells Peter that he loves him, having finally found him after all these years. He wants to share his legacy and power with his son. James Gunn brilliantly orchestrates the interstellar action, wisecracks, and tragedy. He fearlessly evokes his version of Shakespeare in this comic book tale. ""Guardians 2"" is wildly entertaining with the great soul. Hysterical mercenary Rocket, the cybernetic raccoon voiced by sarcastic Bradley Cooper, steals some of the Sovereign batteries as lovely parting gifts from the arrogant golden skinned jerks. Humorless Queen Ayesha, played by wonderfully zealous Elizabeth Debicki, sends her 'gamer' operated space fleet upon the Guardians in retaliation. Fortunately, Ego and his companion Mantis, played by whimsical beauty Pom Klementieff, save our heroes from destruction. Ego tells Peter that he is his father. Peter, Gamora, and Drax, played by brutishly funny Dave Bautista, agree to accompany his Father to his home planet Ego—the planet he created. The visual images of Ego are idyllic and serene. Russell's Ego is both omnipotent and the great enigma. Mantis is the gifted empath, who helps him sleep and protects his secrets. Ego welcomes his son home, revealing his destiny. Ego doesn't necessarily add up. Is this what Peter wished for?Director Gunn's ""Guardians 2"" invents the narrative spectrum of David Hasselhoff jokes, cool retro '70s rock, kick ass martial arts, galactic ship battles, and quirky charming relationships. With Gunn's direction all his stars give their best. Bautista's hulking tatted blue warrior Drax is crude, brave, and soulful. Klementieff's Mantis is mesmerizing charm. She is genuinely kind, crushing on Big Drax. Saldana is awesome. She has a commanding and calming screen presence. Gunn could have leveraged more romance in Gamora and Peter's love story. Throughout Pratt and Saldana generate authentic chemistry. The narrative focus is on Peter's bond with his fathers, and Gamora's reconcile with estranged sister Nebula. Saldana is radiant and noble with Gillan's surprising Nebula. Gillan's humanity emerges as we empathize for her desire to be loved. I think ""Guardians 2"" becomes the story of the Fathers and their son —of love and destiny. All is not what it appears. Russell and Rooker are eloquently polarizing forces. Pratt embodies courage and fearless vulnerability as Peter boldly defines the man he wants to be. ""Guardians 2"" is touchingly, tearfully about unconditional love and choice. Considering the grand design of the movie that is the wondrous surprise. Simple and sweet. I loved ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2""."
10,Excellent Movie,6 May 2017,"I'm of a older generation but have always loved sci-fi movies - maybe it was my state of mind or just wanted to be amused and entertained - this movie did it all and more - one of the best movies I have seen - had it all - brilliant story, comedy the whole entertainment that movies should have. This is my first entry ever - that's how much I loved this movie :-)"
10,Finally the wait is over and GOTG2 delivers,29 April 2017,"I haven't been to see a movie on opening night for over 10 years but I've been eagerly waiting for this with bated breathe... Was it as good as the first one? This is hard to judge, I'm not really a Marvel fan and when the first one came out I reluctantly went to the cinema with my kids expecting to be bored watching a dumb sci-fi movie about a raccoon and an walking tree but ended up having a fantastic time, and I'm 47 .. This is the reason the first movie got such positive feedback in my opinion so the sequel was never going to live up to it... but it came very close.I don't like to give reviews with spoilers so I'll give an overall review.. I found GOTG2 a hilarious and exciting ride that left me with a smile on my face for the rest on the night. You know when jokes hit the mark when everyone in the cinema is laughing out loud. The banter between the characters is great especially between Rocket and baby Groot even though baby Groot still only says the same 3 words.After the opening 5 minutes was over I knew I was in for a great time. This is not a bias review from a Marvel fanboy in fact I'm not a fan of the mainstream character movies like Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Avengers etc I loved it, so did everyone in the cinema so you will too..."
10,The Least Little Spoilers for an Outstanding Movie!,8 May 2017,"Prior to seeing Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, I said that it would have a hard time equaling the perfect blend of humor and action that the first Guardians achieved. After seeing Vol. 2, however, I have to say that it achieved a perfect balance of humor, action and even tear-jerking drama. Although I would hardly have believed it possible, I enjoyed Vol. 2 a bit more even than the first Guardians movie.Chris Pratt does such a brilliant job of conveying dry, understated humor that it's easy to take for his performance for granted, but when I, and the rest of the theater, laughed over and over, it served as a good reminder just what great comedic talent he brings to what are genuinely serious superhero movies. Not to be outdone, Kurt Russell—a talented actor of whom I just haven't seen enough in recent years—did a brilliant job of making Star Lord's father completely believable, even relatable, at the same time he turns totally creepy on us.I have to give a shout out to Zoe Saldana, who some of you might know as Uhura in the Kelvin timeline Star Trek movies. It's hard for anyone to reprise the role brought so lovingly to life by Nichelle Nichols in original Star Trek, and I didn't even recognize Zoe under all that green makeup in the first Guardians movie. Knowing who she was in Vol. 2, however, I was impressed by her range as an actress, as she made Gamora completely and unrecognizably different than her Uhura. Another talented actress I didn't recognize under all her makeup (or prosthetics) was Karen Gillian, who some of you might know as the red-haired beauty who played Amy Pond in 36 episodes of Doctor Who. Once again, her range as an actress made her character, Nebula, completely and utterly different from her Amy.Sean Gunn, perhaps a less-familiar actor, unless you, like me, happen to enjoy both superhero movies and ""chick"" shows, brought the same sort of lovably bumbling humor to the character of Kraglin in the movie that he brought so enjoyably most weeks on the Gilmore Girls TV series. Gunn's performance contributed greatly to the movie's ability to make the entire audience laugh even when Chris Pratt wasn't on the screen.Once you've seen Vol. 2—and definitely not before—take a gander in the Internet Movie Database at the movie's cast, and you may be surprised to see several other talented actors playing roles either openly (but not advertised beforehand) or hidden behind makeup or CGI. Some of them you'll have already happily recognized during the movie, but the list of others that you probably didn't recognize might well delight you as did me. Let me warn you again though: if you haven't seen the movie yet, do NOT look at IMDb.I would be remiss if I didn't mention the movie's absolutely outstanding use of 1970s music. Someone on the production crew grew up at the same time I did, and I have to give him or her credit for choosing some great songs from our youth that fit the events of the movie perfectly. The first movie had good period music too, but I have to say that when it comes to the appropriate use of 1970s music, the filmmakers might accurately have titled the Vol. 2 movie Guardians Beyond.If you do go see Guardians Vol. 2—and I've tried my best to gush about the movie without giving away a single darned spoiler—make sure you sit through the closing credits to the very, absolutely final, last second. Don't just wait patiently, either, for during-credits or after-credits scenes, but really, really, really try to pay attention to both the words and the images in the credits themselves, and you will be richly rewarded with even more humor.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 represents another unqualified cinematic triumph for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and sets the stage for what could well end up being at least two more. As a major DC Comics fan for more than half a century, I have to say that I wish the DC Expanded Universe movies had even a quarter as much talent putting together live-action DC superhero movies. Is there any chance that Warner Brothers might borrow some of the leading creative lights of Disney's Marvel Studios for at least one superhero movie?!"
10,The First Was My Favourite Film. This One Tops It.,4 May 2017,"I adored the first Guardians of the Galaxy. Like many, I was blown away having gone in with no expectations, and laughed and grinned through the entire thing. It became my favourite film, on its own until Denis Villeneuve's masterpiece Arrival profoundly moved me, and so the stakes were high for the sequel that I arrived to with Baby Groot bobble-head in hand (bringing my cardboard cut-out was logistically impractical).When I went to the midnight screening (28th of April in the UK), I loved it. Everyone in the room did. From the very first scene where the rich visuals filled my eyes, to the following scene, which made, and continues to make, me grin from ear to ear and is my favourite scene in cinema. to the laughs and action and thoughtful moments that made up the rest of this film; they managed to take all that was great about the first and ramp it up.So yes, I exited the cinema at something past 2 in the morning, utterly delighted. I wanted to go again. And that I did. In the first five days of the film being open in the UK, I watched it four times (at three separate cinemas), and I have to say that I have been delighted with it every single time.Standout performances in this film must go to Drax, Rocket and Yondu—with the former taking the lead in laugh-out-loud moments in this film—while Kurt Russell has an absolute ball as Ego.One of the many, many things that I loved about this film (whose soundtrack, I would argue—having had it on hard rotation for this last week—surpasses the first's) is the fact that James Gunn's work is self- aware. We saw some of this in Deadpool, as Ryan Reynolds spent his time making fun of 'superhero landing's and similar superhero movie tropes, despite falling into a number of those, itself. In Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, we see a step up from this. Instead of making fun of the clichés that come along with this sort of film, they embrace them and ramp it up at times, having the duel effect of accepting that there are certain hoops that need to be jumped through while also retaining the sense of fun and ham for which the first was so lauded. Additionally, this also means that any sentimental message is passed on, while also you're aware that the tongue is rooted firmly in cheek: much akin to somebody who uses hyperbole to tell their partner that they physically radiate beauty- although the manner of delivery isn't meant to be taken seriously, the message is still genuine. Chris Pratt does this very well; I'm convinced he's not a very good dramatist, he's just such a charismatic and funny person that he gets away with it, which works perfectly well in situations like this, as he makes comments that plainly point towards motifs within the film which, in a Shawshank or a film of that ilk would seem out of place and stilted, but work brilliantly in the context. (Disclaimer: I haven't seen Passengers and so don't know whether his performance here proves wrong my theory about his acting chops)There are moments throughout the film that are surprisingly brutal for a Marvel film, definitely a high-end 12A, but not out of place, and there is a general joy that easily balances this out. If you go to see Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2, you should absolutely love it. Admittedly, I went in with a lot vested in the film being good, but I have been to see it thrice more after that, and it still holds up for me. What I would say, as was the case with my brother, is that going a second time may help because this film is chocked full (both in the sense of the story-line and visually) and going multiple times allows you to notice little moments throughout—with there easter eggs galore for the Marvel fan, including references to the previous film. Also, I would recommend going to see it in 2D on your first showing: I went in 2D for my first two viewings, then IMAX 3D and then 2D again, and—although the 3D has some absolutely beautiful moments and really is striking—I found that it distracted from the film at times and I spent time looking at the film, rather than watching it. So yes, I could not recommend this film highly enough. James Gunn does a fantastic job of giving us a film that helps us learn more about these characters; care more about them; see them in battle and, most importantly, meet Baby Groot, who is a complete and utter delight. Bar one moment of slightly choppy editing (although this may just be my four viewings showing an over-analysis that most people won't notice) I could not fault it for the way it was put together, mixing light moments with dark brilliantly and keeping an excellent pace, and all of the cast are thoroughly watchable, with it a joy to be back in this gang's company.Now, if you don't mind me, I'm going to go and re-watch the original, before, potentially, going back to the cinema this weekend. I am Groot."
9,Father and Son Connection,8 May 2017,"The first ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" was a welcome surprise, with engaging characters, funny lines, and a great portrayal of friendship in the most unexpected places. Times goes on, and relationships evolve and deepen in most cases. So in the end, there's plenty of action, back stories are connected, and it sort of makes sense.The gang is at the center of mess started by Rocket when he steals some valuable items from their employers. Retaliation promptly involves a gang of thugs in pursue of our gang, and things become more complicated with the arrival of Peter's long lost father. This results in a series of interesting moments between father and son, but there's a nagging feeling that something doesn't fit, or that the whole truth is not out being told. The mystery keeps the story going, until the explosive revelations in the last section of the film.The same elements that made the original successful are back, with everyone still displaying affection for each other in their own peculiar way. Rocket is rough at the edges but can't hide his soft side. There's plenty of cuteness in Baby Groot, and Saldana and Pratt are still working out the ""unspoken"" aspects of their relationship.One should enjoy the visuals for most of the film, and the story unfolding with the best coupling of pop music and a story line since ""Mamma Mia"". There's a sense of nostalgia that wasn't present in the first film, and using some obscure pieces makes their success even more interesting.The bottom line is this works well, and we're looking forward to Groot's next growing phase."
9,Awesome movie,7 May 2017,"Great movie. Mixed emotions very well and balanced a ton of characters amazingly. The story was intense and the character development was insane. Thought it was better than the first one. I recommend going to see this movie right away, not only because it's great but because there are some spoilers that you shouldn't hear about before seeing the movie."
8,A compelling and funny sequel,28 April 2017,"James Gunn returns with the sequel to the Guardians of the Galaxy with a movie that brings back many of the things that made the original so great. Is it greater than the first though? It is hard to rank one above the other, but I still believe the first installment (in what is now going to be a trilogy) deserves the nod. Led by the continuously likable and charismatic Chris Pratt as Star-Lord, we join the Guardians on a journey across the planets and galaxies. Vol. 2 introduces many new characters such as Mantis and Peter Quill aka Star Lord's father, Ego, the latter played by Kurt Russell. The characters of Drax and Rocket were hilarious as usual, Drax especially in many scenes. We learn more of the intense relationship between the sisters Gamora and Nebula, but there were two who really stood out for me: Baby Groot and (surprisingly) Yondu. Baby Groots time on camera created many laughs, not just for his sheer cuteness, but for his interactions with the other characters. Yondu in this movie was given far more story to deal with, and it certainly paid off. It made you really care for him on an emotional level, which does sound quite unusual given he is a ravager. And last but not least, Star-Lord, and being the lead character, deserved all the attention because he was great. The movie was another great entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe and has created more anticipation for Avengers: Infinity Wars where we will see the Avengers team up with the Guardians. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 will provide more laughs, more emotion and more action for any movie viewer, led by a great director and cast."
10,"Action, drama, comedy and might even be better then the first one!",6 May 2017,"I went into the movie blind, I expected something OK-ish but Vol.3 might actually be better then the first one!The movie focuses more on developing the characters and shedding some light on their back stories making them more solid as people... well almost everyone, oddly enough there is just one character in the whole movie that doesn't gain any depth and yet manages to steal every single scene he's in and that's Drax (played by he of the infectious laugh Dave Bautista)Fast paced and action filled what really shines in this flick is oddly enough it's comedic timing and choice of sound track, The humor here comes at you from left field (or from Drax, just him laughing will tickle your funny bone!) so it's never expected. They try to push baby groot's cuteness a bit much for my taste and I did end up liking the rougher characters more (Rocket, Yondu and Drax) which more then made up for it. This was the first movie that made me want to run and get the sound track, I think the music here is even better then the first one.10/10 from me, I'd recommend it to the whole family, even though there is violence in the movie it's done in a tongue and cheek way and never ""too"" grotesque,,, it's hard to think ""oh dear he killed everyone"" when you're laughing so hard!"
10,Into the GalaxyAgain,11 July 2017,"Based on fictional space faring superheroes, this new installment to the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise, follows a group of superheroes who go into the far reaches of the galaxy to defeat big bad enemies who want to take over the galaxy and the universe. In 2014, we were introduced to Star Lord (Peter Quill) (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista), Groot (Vin Diesel), Rocket (Bradley Cooper) – this band of misfits were formed to protect the galaxy at all costs. Now a new threat has emerged, but in the unlikely person who would ever want to destroy the galaxy but also to bring his son in on the family business (OOPS! Have I said too much already.) With this all-star cast including Oscar Award, Golden Globe, and Screen Actor winner Kurt Russell – this movie will keep you on your toes, literally. With all these Marvel movies, tying into together and the post and mid credit scenes, this movie is extremely important to the future of the galaxy, but I will save that for you to decide."
8,Original is the Best but Love This One Too,11 June 2017,"It is the characters that we have grown to come and love. And that Peter Quill and his team are back. And how that they end up being the Guardians of the Galaxy officially fighting bad guys.But when Rocket steals something from the people that they were working, named Sovereign for in addition to getting Gamora's estranged wicked Nebula as she has reasons of her own over wanting to get her good sister back.Sovereign wants them to pay but Kurt Russell's Ego character(Yes that is his name), saves them and reveals he is Peter's father. Minus Groot and Rocket who stay behind to fix their wounded ship, the others go with Ego and his right hand woman, Mantis. Who never experienced being included with people except for Ego. Not just showing them his planet. Plus he wants his estranged son to join in on his cause in his own planet.Until the others find something strange on the planet. And try to warn Peter. While Rocket and Baby Groot fight with the other villains and ultimately team up with Michael Rooker to bring the Guardians back safe.It is really good but the original is the original. No matter how many sequels there are. But it is really loads of fun and action and humor and romance."
10,Great Entertainment,10 May 2017,"Superb film.Funny, had a lot of guest appearances.Great soundtrack Looking forward to Number 3.Already wanting to watch it again at the cinemas.Batista is great in this,"
9,Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,25 April 2017,"The Autistic Reviewers have been waiting for this movie to come out for ages now. The biggest question is: Was it worth the wait? You bet it was! ""Set to the backdrop of Awesome Mixtape #2, 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' continues the team's adventures as they unravel the mystery of Peter Quill's true parentage."" It picks exactly where the last one left off. The moment the film starts off you know you are in for the ride of your life. The intro is easily one of the most memorable, hilarious and action packed things you'll see in a superhero movie. The sequel never loses its touch with the humor the first one provided. It also had really nice touches of emotion/sadness to it. it's also filled with twists and turns that you'll never see coming.All the cast from the first one return. We have brand new characters in the movie such as Mantis (Pom Klementieff), Stakar Ogord (Sylvester Stallone), Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki), and Ego (Kurt Russel). Kurt Russel really steals a lot of the show as soon as he is on screen. What's surprising is Yondu. He has way more screen time in this one than he does in the first one. Michael Rooker plays him so well. But once again it's Rocket (Bradley Cooper) who gets most of the humor in this one.It's action packed, it's never boring, it's hilarious and it's very emotional in loads of scenes with loads of twists and turns. What's not to love? Jay gives this 4.5/5 where as Nick gives this a 5/5 stars. Really check us out on facebook or Instagram! The Autistic Reviewers."
10,Crazy Trip to the MCU Cosmic World,24 April 2017,"Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol.2 is freaking good from the very beginning till end! If you like the first chapter, then you'll definitely love Volume 2. The relations between every character evolve and every one of them got a special moment in the movie. Now, we all knew that Baby Groot is adorable and predictably he'll stole the show, but man...Drax, Rocket, Gamora, Nebula, Yondu even Mantis they're all awesome in their way. Of Course Star Lord makes what he can do best, leading the group of a**holes.The cinematography, the stable and funny story, the brilliant colors, that James Gunn added to this movie are just fabulous! The comedy is totally on point. Action scenes are great. The music? Well you can listen the GOTG Vol.2 songs over and over again and they all works perfectly in the context of the movie.Phase 3 of MCU is very strong first with Civil War, then Doctor Strange and now Guardians doesn't disappoint at all. This is truly one hell of a movie and you MUST watch it at any cost! Don't leave the theaters till the very end of the final text of the credits, there're a few surprises."
1,Our every year ritualistic going-to-the-theater-to-watch-a Marvel-movie finally begins.,26 April 2017,"I feel like a drone. Every year Marvel comes out with its new set of movies and every year like drones we all go out to see them. And for this reason Marvel makes tons of $$$ without any quality improvement or originality, because as drones, we all just gobble it up. It's like we have been given a command: ""This year you will see the following movies and not hold them to any standard, kapeesh!!"" Marvel movie story lines have been declining while at the same time special effects and better actors getting hired has been increasing. Like how winning an Oscar now lands you a role in a super hero/big budget production rather than another artistic role: Brie Larson in Captain Marvel (and the horrible Kong), Lupita Nyong'o in Star Wars (ok, that's not Marvel, but still a huge franchise.), Jared Leto as the Joker (DC, I know), but you get the picture. This creates a conundrum in our heads: good acting, great special effects, bad story writing, so, hmmmm.......does this mean that I liked it? Should I go with the flow and say I liked it, because critics aren't gonna diss a movie that's sure to make $$$ and I don't wanna seem like a killjoy or shame myself in front of my firends? You know, I'll see the next Marvel movie and then decide.And so this year, the cycle begins with us giving our money to Guardians of the Galaxy V2. Expect nothing more than what the trailer has to offer. Or see the first one again and it'll be the same as seeing V2, you'll just save money. The story does advance with Kurt Russell starring as Starlord's dad. Kind of a rehash of ""No/Luke....I am your father."" It's good when they hire good actors. Make-up and special effects are great. But in all, I wouldn't use the words ""enjoyable"" or ""exciting."" I'll just say, ""Ritual completed, onto the next superhero movie.""Hey I'm a victim here nonetheless. I'm not criticizing people for seeing Guardians, as I also did, but I'm getting to get critical of us who every year, dish out our money for these superhero movies, which are in fact not becoming any better in quality, and studio execs thinking that they are creating masterpieces because of the gross $$$, hence thereforth making no extra effort to make a better movie. So see it, or stay at home and stare at the wall...it's up to you. If ya got nothing better to do then what else should ya do??I'd just like to rename this movie: Guardians of Ga'ahoole: The Owls of the Galxay."
10,Funny and Action Packed!,8 May 2017,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is the 15th in the Marvel Universe (i wonder how the studio hasn't ran out of ideas). This film focuses on the guardians and how they must fight off the gold people after stealing something of theirs, while Star Lord discovers his father and discovers the truth about him. That is one of the things i loved about this movie, so many things are going on and it is not distracting at all. It still manages to stay fresh and funny. The actors are still pretty good and some have improved over the last movie like Drax and Yondu. I also thought Ego(star lord's father) was a fantastic character. The dialogue is funny and very creative. As always the CGI is very good and the movie just looked beautiful. As far as action goes, i thought this was a great improvement. In the end, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is the best movie i have seen all year so far, as it improves with the characters, plot, action sequences, and comedy. A+ or 10/10. AHHH MY NIPPLES!-Drax"
10,Family Time,28 August 2017,"When a sequel is released following in the footsteps of a popular and well-loved movie the bar is set high by any and all going to see it. Expectations are high and if the follow up doesn't equal that of the first film it could result in the end of a series or low box office figures. Termed the ""sophomore slump"" more than one second film has fallen prey to this occurring.I've loved all of the Marvel Universe films (and Netflix series) to date, more so than any that DC has released where only WONDER WOMAN has succeeded. I enjoyed GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY immensely, a perfect combination of action, comic book love, special effects and humor. When the sequel, GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL. 2 came out I was there the first week to see it. I left disappointed feeling it hadn't lived up to my expectations. So I was anxious for it to come out on disc so I could watch it again and see it through different eyes, eyes not filled with expectations of the previous film. I'm glad I did.The movie starts in the distant past as Peter Quill's mother Meredith rides down the road in an open topped convertible singing ""Brandy"" as her handsome young beau (Kurt Russell) drives. They end up in a woods where he shows her something he has planted in the ground and both convey their love for one another. Fast forward to outer space.The Guardians have been hired by the Sovereign to protect their all-important batteries from a marauding inter-dimensional monster. As it arrives the battle begins as does my favorite part of the film. Baby Groot hooks up a sound system to play music, something Peter aka Star Lord (Chris Pratt) enjoys. With the tune ""Mr. Blue Sky"" blaring from the speakers baby Groot dances across the battlefield oblivious to the raging fight taking place around him. If it doesn't make your heart dance with joy to see him you have no heart.The team is victorious and get their reward – Nebula (Karen Gillan) Gamora's (Zoe Saldana) sister. Peter warns them to be cautious as the Sovereign are an easily offended group which of course results in Rocket (voice of Bradley Cooper) cracking wise at their expense. Heading out into space they are then attacked by the Sovereign, looking for the batteries stolen by Rocket which he failed to mention. As things appear to be at their worst another spaceship shows up with a man on top who obliterates the remaining Sovereign ships.Crash landing and beginning repairs that same spaceship lands and out walks a man known as Ego who informs Peter that he is his father. Here before him is the man he's been searching for all these years. A man who has been searching for Peter as well. While Rocket and Groot remain behind to fix the ship, with Nebula still a prisoner, the rest go with Ego to his planet at the far edge of the galaxy. But what is it that he really wants? This will become the problem all face eventually.As this unfolds we also find out what has become of Yondu (Michael Rooker), Peter's once father figure and the man who was tracking him down in the first film. We learn that his particular group of Ravagers were exiled because of his taking Peter years ago. At his lowest he is approached by the Sovereign to find the Guardians and retrieve their batteries.Two themes run throughout this film. The first is that of family and fathers in particular. The Guardians are more than just a rag tag group of adventurers. Each has lost something or someone in their past and they have bonded together as a family in their time together. And each father figure has some flaw that makes them not the father they could have been but all attempt to redeem themselves for the most part save one. This presents a much deeper film than one would expect from a comic based movie.The movie entertains on all levels from the stunning special effects visuals to the story telling itself. The acting is amazing when you consider that beneath the bluster and wise cracking heroics on display is that search for answers to familial matters. This includes not just fathers but sisters as well with Nebula and Gamora trying to find their own answers. In addition to that there are some belly busting funny moments as well, nearly all involving Drax (Dave Batista) who does a fantastic job with them.On second viewing, without preconceived ideas in mind, I loved this movie. It might not be equal to the first but it is very close. The concepts that run through this film strike at the heart which is never a bad thing when handled well. Here it is handled exceptionally well. This is a movie to be added to any and all collections and watched more than once."
10,Great movie and very entertaining,17 May 2017,"Positive + Interesting plot but a bit simplistic. + Very funny, even more than actual comedies. + Great character development. We learn more about all the characters, their past and their motivations. + Amazing visuals. + Good action sequences. + Baby Groot is very cute.Negative - The main villain looses his recognizable face, making it harder for the viewer to feel him as the bad guy. - Yondu's arrow is much too powerful, a way to solve any difficult situation. Feels almost like cheating.Great movie. Might not be as big as the first but still very entertaining.5 Stars"
10,"""Sha-la-la-la-la-la thing""",8 May 2017,"""Oooh-oooh baby, we've been a long, long way and"".. seeing continuing of Guardians adventures and all that crazy things that happened in galaxy, I am lucky, because movie is greatest than first one. First minutes and I already think that it is, so beautiful and creative, funny and with some life. You look and live there on screens and feel all that fells Guardian team. Of course, director and screenwriter are great guys and other production team that in such nice way filmed that. Aah, music, make a big job there, great songs, they are beautiful and like to listening them, they make some deep emotions into movie with fun and sadness at same time. Oh, and actors, already knowing old retro-guy Kurt Russell and I don't know about Sylvester Stallone and was very surprised when I see him on screen, he is great, oh nostalgia. Beautiful Gamora, charismatic Peter Quill, love this character, MAN, and crazy Drax, reactive Rocket and cute kid Groot, and story around Yondu warmed my heart. It is funny and nice that they put a lot of different stories about each other, they have stories and a lot to say, in one move where interweave in one and one end, that was lovely to tears, exactly, tears, I have cried and was proud and happy. This family and friendship such strong, and so nice to be part of that team, to see and to be there, even if a little time. And proud as well that I can see Guardians of the Galaxy and know more about. Maybe you can even write something more deep and great, some wham, bam shang-a-lang and a sha-la-la-la-la-la review things, but that's all about this movie - wham bam shang-a-lang and more!"
10,Best Marvel Flick to Date,6 May 2017,"Being its own universe away from the comics (as has always been) I went into this already knowing to expect some things I've known and loved since childhood reading comics, as well as surprising things that were and are new to the MCU. Blew me away to say the least. I got the nostalgia feeling mixed with the new action packed and new spins on characters feelings :). Nothing I didn't like about this movie to be honest so rated a perfect 10. Graphics were amazing, acting was great, it was hilarious at moments, action-packed throughout, and had me at the edge of my seat for the duration. I think this is all a movie should do and it achieved it."
1,Dreadful - 180 degrees from the first one,19 May 2017,"Me and my boy were thinking wtf is going on in the cinema. Everyone in GOTG has gone emotional & sentimental, looking for sister touch, father touch. Action is sporadic and childish. No cool moments, musics have lost the spirits. Way less funny than the first one. I hardly laughed, like watching paint dry. My 13 years son ends up playing on his mobile, not bother watching.How other people love this move is beyond me. Obviously they have very different standard, easily entertained."
1,What the hell did I just watch?,6 May 2017,"I actually lost a lot of brain cells today. I should have trusted my instinct which told me after 10 minutes of atrociously written, poorly shot and nauseatingly acted nonsense that I should leave. But I said to myself, lets stick, maybe it will redeem itself.Oh, but no, it just got worse and worse till it crossed all lines of idiocy. The characters were like disposable stick figures with no concept of personality at all. Jokes were bad, really really bad and you could feel how pathetically they were inserted into the movie just to give it some redeeming value in form of comic reliefs which also failed.I left in the mid-movie as I could just easily sit and stare at a blank wall and pay money for it. I still lose the money but at-least get to keep my neurons alive."
1,2+ hours of my life wasted,28 May 2017,"What an awful movie! Totally self-indulgence, overly-sentimental, look-how-cute-we-are movie. No plot -zero, none - just sweetness and lace. Ridiculous waste of time. The first movie was witty, sharply written, original. This one - exactly the opposite. Nothing witty, nothing original, just so much ""cuteness"" I wanted to stick my fingers down my throat and barf.Save your money, but more importantly save your time, and skip this horrendous so-called movie."
